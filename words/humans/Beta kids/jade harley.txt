yep!
i finally finished a present for him
ive been working on it for years!!!!
heheheh.... :)
i just mailed it too so it is sure to get there on time

it is a tip!!!!
did you have a pet a long time ago that died?
ok well how did you feel about your cat, did you love him a lot?
ummmmm ok....
thats fine!!!
it doesnt really matter i think, just.....
what if someone told you you could play a game that would bring him back to life?
yes that someone is me!!!!!!!!
i just thought you might find it interesting
oh i dont know

i think youll hear about it later and maybe you can talk to john and dave about it
they are way more into all that stuff than i am!!!!
_
6. JE4: =002552

and we wont talk again for a pretty long time
not until you enter!
yeah!
lol what did you want to know?
there sure are a lot of challenges but yes i am sure!!
dave is cool, you know he will come around when the time is right
he just has a lot of work to do first
and so do you!
youll need to keep searching for a stable signal and power source, it will be hard but dont give up!!!
and dont worry about me either, focus on playing with john first
it all starts with you two!
haha dark? thats ridiculous!
i dont really know what to tell you other than its not going to be what you think it is
and most importantly you will have your questions answered, but they will be the ones you havent thought to ask yet!
just be patient and be brave youll see
it will be fun!!!!!!
uh oh looks like youve got to go
take care rose! <3<3<3
_
9. KV1: =002759
oh nooooooo

i get that youre a jerk and you should shut up!
goodbye you jerk!!!!!!!!!
_
10. JE5: =002900
yay thank you john!!!!! :D
heheh i know but it is nice of you to think of us all like that!
im sure it is great, i cant wait either!!!!!
it might take a while to get here from there but it will be worth the wait!
john thats ok really! im sure will get to me exactly when it needs to and it will be a nice surprise when it does! 
<3......
uhhhh hold on
ok im back sorry
i had to tell someone to go away!
yup :o
ive never had any sort of feeling about them or what they want which is kind of weird!!!
but it seems to me like they are probably all different people and not one guy
i have counted twelve
some people just like to needle others for some reason john
it is like a game i guess. they are like pranksters!!
but i think they are mostly harmless
every so often they manage to get through my block filter and hassle me. its been going on for years! actually some of them are kind of funny i think hehe

oh!!!!
that reminds me since im setting the game up with dave to be his server you are going to need to do the same thing for me
can you see from where youre standing the place your dads car would have fallen?
you should go there and get your copy of the server and set up with me.....
oh and also get your package!!!!!! :)
johhhhn will you stop trying to trap me!!!
you TOLD me the car fell remember?
jeeeez
JEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEZ!!!!!
john im not any more psychic than you though
hahahaha oops ok!
i mean i know lots of things but im really serious its no more information than what you have access to
but you dont know it yet
anyway we can talk more about it soon.....
i wont have to be so coy with you anymore because im pretty sure most of the stuff that was supposed to happen has already happened
i couldnt tell you about it because it would have messed it up!
just give me a few minutes while i set up this game!
and say hi to the salamanders for me
<3

the timer really just lets you know when its coming

_
22. DS11: =003405
duuurrrrr dave i was going to build some stairs up there durrrrrhhhhhh
gosh i dont know i guess i didnt find the time to make them because i keep getting punched in the face by robots and stuff!!!!!!!
;p
i dont know!
nope....
what was it doing up there?
_
23. DS12: =003407
i think your sprite wants to hatch it!
awww
hmm...
i dont know it looks like its pretty warm where you are
maybe not too long then????
i guess we'll find out!
:(
_
24. DS13: =003410
ok some of these things we can deploy but some things we dont have nearly enough grist for!
no no weve got enough for that.....
but its still pretty expensive
yeah me too!
and we have 2000 to work with
ok 1998 ._.
ohhh...
how much did rose start with? when she was playing with john?
k
i guess we keep getting more with each server/client connection!
no!!!!
i cant buy the holopad thingy and the intellibeam laserstation
hahahaha no theyre right here!
they cost a fortune
yeah ive got that too!
i will deploy it
yes i think that is how it works
when john connects with me he will probably get some cool new things too!
_
25. DS14: =003411
i suppose just hang on to them for a while........
and then later
just do whatever you are naturally compelled to do with them!
_
26. JE9: AND KV2: =003425
JE - COPY OF CONVERSATION JE5: =002900
KV - what do you want?????
this is nonsense
every time i believe something you say you laugh at me and call me a gullible human!!!!
its so childish
D:
i dont know what youre talking about at all.....
its another prank
no
you mean the robot you think is stupid?
the one youve mocked me for having on a number of occasions???
this is the worst prank youve ever pulled!!!!!!
why should i do that?
_
27. DS15: =003463
dave here punch this code!
L229BxoG
and then put it in the jumper shunty thing and see what it does
_
28. DS16: =003464
well i think this is only one way to consolidate all the gizmo features....
hang on ill give you more codes!!!
_
29. RL3: =003527
hehehe......
yeah i bet hes right!
wow no i dont think so...
hes being a bit more literal than that!
what did he say?
:)
well what he meant was.....
that you have a dream self
who is supposed to wake up whenever your real self goes to sleep
we all do! all four of us i mean
but see your dream self still stays asleep when you go to sleep
because you havent woken up yet!
yes
no you would not be out of line!
in fact im asleep now
:p
no only i can do that!
because of my robot
you guys can probably make your own i guess......
but you need to wake up first for it to matter and maybe by the time that happens you might not even need them!!!
um.......
ok well i dont really know how to answer the second part but yeah shes dreaming!
shes most likely lying in your bed troubled and restless
about things burdening her
which is to say you!!!!!
things about who you really are and what your purpose is
but you cant start figuring those things out yet because youre not awake because youre not ready yet
thats why you have such terrible dreams all the time rose!
im sure it would help to start piecing together the clues to nudge your subconscious
or maybe face some things you havent faced yet?
i dunno! its for you to find out
maybe the stuff you wrote on your walls can give you a clue?
the....
er
didnt dave tell you?
._.
he said he was going to tell you <_<;
_
30. RL4: =003529
yeah hes pretty tied up right now!
noooooooooooooooooooo
_
31. RL5: =003530
he made me promise not to bug him while im asleep!
but he will find a way to be clever and make me punch myself in the face again :(

ummmmmm.....
oh! yes it appears so!!!
i guess! ive been pretty busy here
ive had to stay asleep for a long time because john is supposed to wake up soon
but he just wont wake up!!!!!
im pretty sure im supposed to be the one to wake him but i dont know what to do :(
huh??
oh......
well thanks for trying anyway!
i hope so!
what am i doing when i wake up?
oh no!!!!!
yes i know what you mean....
that sounds like it would be fun!
but you guys never even played pranks on me, you were always just kinda mean D:
well i know i havent trolled you guys!
or not yet.........
heheheh
oh yeah!
i totally forgot about that
does it really blow up or was that another trick?
hmmmmm
you could ask me in the future!
is he not a nice guy?
hmmm....
well maybe hes just been through some tough times
maybe we should give him the benefit of the doubt?
for whatever its worth i think youre a pretty nice guy too!
also you seem to be the only one who ever thinks to talk to me while im asleep!
why is that?
oh no!!!
dream selves can die?
i never knew that
or even thought about it....
i guess it makes sense though
_
34. JE10: =003857
dear john,
happy birthday!!!!!!! :D
even though its super late and you probably went through a lot of trouble to get it, i really hope this present cheers you up! you looked so sad while you were reading my letter. um... which is to say, the one you are reading now. i can explain!!!
you see, when i go to sleep, in my dreams i wake up on the moon of a planet called prospit. by now you must know about this place! i have lived there in my dreams most of my life and i made so many friends there over the years. and you were there too! but you were asleep. the fact that you are awake now i think means all my friends are in trouble. you are awake because it is your job to help them. we will both help them!
but ummm..... i know these things because while i was on the moon, whenever it passed through skaia i could see lots of things in the clouds. the past, the future, stuff about our friends, and stuff about you! now that you are awake, and apparently at the center of skaia (??? WOW!!!) you should be able to see stuff in the clouds too. maybe you already have!
about this present! my penpal helped me work on it. he included a letter too! hes really funny and silly, i like him a lot and i think you would too. it took a long time between the two of us. and sure the present looks like a fun and completely ridiculous thing to get, but it is also really important! you are getting it exactly when you need it most. maybe thats hard to believe but its true! i saw it happen already. i dont see everything john, and i definitely dont know everything thats going to happen. but when i do know something, i always try to do my best to help people in the future! when im supposed to that is. youll get the hang of it.
john i am REALLY looking forward to seeing you when you wake up!!!!! its been nice playing with my prospitian friends and all, but also kind of lonely knowing you were in the other tower sleeping and having lousy dreams. :( im not sure where i am when you are reading this but im sure ill make it down to where you are soon! (jeez how did you get down there??? oh well ill find out) i cant wait to fly around the moon with you and show you all my favorite places. itll be so much fun!!!!!!!!! :D

what!!!!!
see what!
go away
bluhhh what are you talking about....
my head hurts
just stop it, stop trolling me
i hate you all!!!!!!!!!!!!!
about what!
i dont remember talking to you at all
my dream was horrible!!!
i dont know what that was, i have never dreamed anything like it
oh god....
prospit :(
is it really gone?
uuuuuuuuugh D:
oh......
that was you?
argh
sorry but
could you please
not use all those stupid parentheses??????
i can hardly read what you type and its giving me a migraine
what about the -E thing, can you stop that too? it is also annoying and stupid
meh :\
hehehe
ok, sorry for sounding bossy
you seem pretty nice, and you sure do look exotic
i kind of always thought you were all like
a bunch of really obnoxious humans
hey feferi, i would like to remember......
but everything is so foggy right now
i remember prospit being attacked
and
falling.....
aaaand
i dunno :(
do you know what happened?
fffffff
yeah, i gathered that! XC
ohhhhhhh!!!!!
i do remember you!
i remember you were talking to me about my lusus, and i had no idea what you were talking about
and still sort of dont :\
but you must mean bec
also it was shortly before your friend sent me a weird message
about how my robot was going to explode, and i should talk to him when it happens
this was months ago
it was the most awful and angry one
i am so sick of him, i really dont want to talk to that pathetic jerk ever
thats his name?
hmmmm
thats right, it was about some kind of plan...
which he said me from the future told him about?
i thought it was total nonsense at the time
but
i guess he was telling the truth
so maybe i should talk to him? i dont know
ewwwww
ewwwwwwwwwwww!
fish aliens are weird
ok feferi, it was nice talking to you
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
i am never going to sleep again!
never never never never never never
yes, im so tired
:(
well, ok
bye
_
36. KV3: =004751
ok, my robot exploded
now what smart guy!
i knew i would regret this
talking to you is so terrible
its making my headache worse
uuuugh shut uuuuup!
will you just tell me what you wanted?
i cant believe i fell for this
it was just a setup to troll me some more
why do you go to such lengths to troll me? i just dont understand it
thats ridiculous, humanning isnt a word
and if it was, it would be a nicer thing to do than trolling!
you know what i mean, stop pretending you dont
aaaaaaa that is something a troll would say!
i mean you are being patronizing and disingenuous to get a rise out of me
and that is really really shitty!!!!!!
i am so tired of it, and i am done talking to you forever
bye karkat, it was awful knowing you!
yes
as if my day needed another reason to get worse
what does that mean!
is this another prank
you are seriously the worst at pranks
:|
_
37. KV4; DS17: =004752
oh jeez, why am i doing this
this is so stupid!
bluhhh youre so funny!!!!!
are you enjoying yourself karkat?
well obviously i know some things youve said are true
its just hard to take everything at face value when youre always so nasty!
ok i understand that you are another group of players and you are in some sort of trouble
but maybe if you had been nice to me instead of terrorizing me all those years i would have believed you
and we could have worked together to solve your problems as well as ours
it just makes me sad to think thats probably impossible now because you are so angry and stubborn!
uh huh
sure karkat, whatever you say!
aaauugh what the hell!!!
i cant take this anymore!!!!!!!!
i dont even know what im reading here but its preposterous and ive had it!
i am just so angry, i cant believe i let you push me around all those years
you are completely out of your mind, i was too nice by just blocking you and typing frowny faces and stuff
i should have let you HAVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
SHUT UP!!!!!!!
future karkat, if you really are future karkat......
where do you get off thinking you can just suddenly act like were pals because you said you apologized????
if you want to apologize then great i am all ears! but just mentioning it off hand and then yelling at yourself the same way you yell at me all the time as if i need a knight to come save me from yourself is so lame, not to mention completely insane
i cant even believe the things im typing here! this is so stupid, talking to two of you at once is the worst thing imaginable
you treat everyone horribly, even yourself, i cant even fathom how awful it is to be you
past karkat, youre acting like a bigger jerk than he is and i think you know that! why dont you take his advice and grow up
as if theres even a real difference between you two. three hours is hardly any time at all, you are the same person YOU FUCKING IDIOTS!!!!!!!!!
stop it!!!!
ugh, i dont know whats worse, jerk karkat or goofy sycophant karkat
i cant stand it, whether youre trying to be nice or just being a crazy asshole, you are just so weird!!!
im through humoring you, i dont even care about this stupid exploded robot mission, whatever that was
hahaha, FAT CHANCE!!!!
dave wait dont go!
youve got to save me from this insanity :(
i cant wait for future you to future kiss my ass!
i also cant wait for past you to past drop dead and go to hell, PAST TENSE!!!!!!!!
when are those things going to happen?? or will have already past/future happened?????
i want to put another reminder on my finger so i know when its time to throw a party!!!!
jesus will you just ban me already????
my head hurts so bad now i think im going to cry
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa XO
i will just ban myself!!!!

38. JE11: =004768
john are you there???
yes!
im so relieved to talk to you and hear youre ok
i mean.......
are you ok john? your dream self i mean
:(
yes, but that was not prospit. that was its moon which was severed by the crazy derse agent
i dunno!
really?? :D
<3
i dont know! i did not give him one after applying the upgrades
i gave her a girls name when i was very young, but now she is a different bunny, and also a boy i guess?
its up to you john, he is your bunny
hahahaha
again?
you were at roses house??
what!!!!
D:
he is angry and a huge pain in the ass
have you ever talked to two of him at once????
dont ever do it!
you will get a headache
noooooooo, think again
????
:|
you mean from armageddon?
john that is so stupid
but also kind of cute i guess
ok then the bunny will be named after your silly movie star fantasy crush
yeah......
that reminds me john
have you looked in the lab yet?
the big room in the sphere at the top of the tower
could you do me a favor and not look in there?
its nothing that secret or personal or anything....
it is just something kind of sad and weird for you to see
it is my dead dream self
it has been there for years, i always knew i would die but i did not realize it would go like this....
what?
oh no!!!!!
im sorry john :(
i understand
ummmmmmm
i think i would rather not talk about that either
you did????
oh nooooooo
john that ring is really important, it belongs to the white queen!
when you go to sleep again, you should try to find it and keep it safe!
yes i have seen it, it is so huge ._.
how much time do you suppose we have?
_
39. JE12: =004780
hmmmm i wonder what the significance of that number is
but they usually do!
yes, youre right
i dont know...
there are so many possibilities
hmmmmmm!
yes, it sure seems that way
well
maybe you will get that chance john
yes, as a matter of fact i am sure we will both get that chance!
i once dreamt that we would
sure, why not!
that is what i believe this game is for in part
you got to bring back your nanna, rose brought back her cat, i can bring back grandpa, and dave...
dave got to bring back a dead bird because of course he is too cool to have any dead family members
wait, he did????
that is
soooo cooooool :O
i almost completely forgot i was his server player!!!!!
i hope hes not in trouble, i should check on him
we probably have so much to catch up on 
i dont see him in his house either :(
oh, ok...
jeez, i feel so out of the loop :(
yes! ok here i go
what!
augh, nooooooooooooooo
oh god, dont get me started :|
he was a strange and silly man
hmmmmmmm, perhaps
is that allowed?
yes, thats a good idea
_
40. JE13: =004787
it is some sort of terrible creature my grandpa hunted
he called it the typheus minion
i always hated it!
i guess so
it is probably a coincidence though
yeah maybe.....
i guess it would make sense for someone to name a really awful web browser after such a hideous monster
well sorry, i just found it sort of a weird and creepy thing to grow up with!
:p!!!!!!
joooohhhhhn, it is so crappy
YEAH RIGHT
now is obviously not the best time to have the argument about whose browser is better....
but really john you should upgrade to echidna, its so much nicer
after you upgrade your clunky old computer of course :P
maybe when i am in the game, i can give you one of mine!
oh???
:O
omg
john that is incredible
i cant wait to make stuff like that!!!!!!
except...
all my awesome stuff exploded with my room :(
yay!!!
_
41. JE14: =004790
what is the problem!!!!
yes
nice!
how much time?
D:
john, try to be more careful!
um.....
what?
_
42. DS18*: =004807
dave!
are you busy?
i dont have much time!
i am about to make my entry item, and its a little confusing
i think the more players we add, the trickier they are to... um......
activate!
like yours was
i figured we could brainstorm about it, while john fusses with the kernel
helloooooo?
:o
:\
whaaat....?
dammit dave!!!!!!
this is really urgent!
._.
_
43. FP2: =004891
oh.............
noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
but youre a troll
and thats what trolls do!
even when they say they wont
sometimes especially!!!!!!
ok.....
even though i still have no idea what youre talking about
whats a lusus!!!!!
:\
ok feferi. what is it?
i dont understand
whats a dream bubble?
ugh
feferi i thought you said you were going to stop using your typing quirk!
i dont know... im sure i remember you said that
oh
yeah it is
i dont know what i was thinking
i just had a major case of deja vu!
i felt like we already had this conversation
actually
it still sort of feels that way
its not going away :o
_
44. FP3: =004892
ummm
what do you mean i never explained it to you?
if this really is the first time we talked, why would i have?
XO
feferi that one was a stretch even by your fish punnery standards
aaah why do i know that you like to make fish puns???
actually
i do remember this conversation
it was in the past!
but if it was in the past, then where am i now?
so what is going on?
i dont think i am asleep....
i am not on prospit
oh...
vaguely
so this is a dream?
sorry
i think
i am in the game now, right?
um
_
45. FP4: =004893
why are you here!
are you asleep too?
oh yeah
i do remember that
then why are you here now?
_
46. BS1: =004906
thanks bec, good boy!
soooooo...
can you talk now?
what do you have to say?
_
47. BS2: =004921
what happened in here?
where is everything? all the globes and houseguests...
and the cruxtruder???
and grandpa???????????
bec, what did you do!
has someone been a bad dog??
wait never mind, please dont answer that!!!!
@_@
_
48. DS19: =004924
hey!!!!!
last time i talked to you i was asking for help and you were just nakking at me
what was up with that bro???
you did?
ohhhhhhh
yes, i did get around during that battle didnt i?
it was really intense!!!
those stupid things are impossible to kill :(
in the heat of the fray i didnt notice you!
where were you?
yeah im fine, thanks for asking!
what do you mean you remember seeing me?
was i jumping through time or something?
youre from the future?
:p
john told me you have been doing some time traveling
that is.....
really really awesome!
i knoooooow
it is a really neat place but its freeeeezing :o
wait!
dave!!
uuugh stupid lousy cool dudes
an hour?
:O
i can not believe how cool that is
this is me believing neither that, nor its coolness :O
hmmmm...
i dont know if i get that but ok!
i will?
ok........
but anyway youre right, its coooold!!!!!!
i have to go back inside
i wish i had winter clothes
and if i did, i ALSO wish that my wardrobifier didnt blow up with all of my beautiful clothes inside it :C
im so horribly unprepared for this.... i have never even seen snow before, can you believe that!!!
derp yes dave that is so where i lived
that is as biographically accurate as it gets about me!
no???
isnt it great?????
lava is NOT better than snow :|
you cant play in lava, its no fun
you can only die in lava
eww dave no
no this is so lame
i am hearing an insane and stupid guy say stupid idiot things while wearing dumb sunglasses for lame morons!
heheheh
why dont we play in the snow later
as soon as you get some....................................
..............................
................... 
.......... 
............... 
....... 
....
...
...
.
time 8)
i know youre joking around, you are not too cool at all, you dont even think that
brrrrrr
i forgot :\
i cant!!!
all that stuff blew up
its a long story that involves a pinata and a gun and a very naughty doggie
so anyway, that reminds me ive got to talk to john!
ive got to get him to make me some new gizmos...
assuming thats even possible
_
49. DS20: =004925

john has magic cyclone powers?
whoa....
you guys are all so much better than me, i feel sooooo lame
heehee
maaaybe
:)
oh no
did he lose it in a magic cyclone?
we do?
doing what??
yes
oh jeez, a few hours????
fastest hours :o
but that costs so much grist!!!
omg...
_
50. DS21: =004926
what does this thing do?
on the back of cards?
but
we can already read those!
hmm
but isnt the whole point of captchas that only humans can read them?
and not robots???
_
51. DS22: =004927
anti spam?
yeah obviously!
oh nooo
whats the good news?
dave i still dont know what youre actually doing here
_
52. DS23: =004928
oh....
to give it to john?
but...
you are already roses server player!
and john is mine!
not to mention im yours!!!
can you really be a server player to your own server player?
but i guess
i thought that john sort of.....
HAD to be my server? you know?
_
53. DS24: =004929
well youre from the future right?
dont you know already if itll work?
pretty smooth dave
shades for everybody
8) 8)
_
54. DS25: =004930
so you will be the server for BOTH us ladies???
you just keep getting smoother, i cant handle all this smoothness
ohh...
i guess that makes sense
ok i think i understand that!
yessss thanks dave <3
um
what do you mean rose will check out? :\
uhhhh ok
_
55. DS26: =004931
it does doesnt it
how long?
ok thats not THAT long :p
_
56. DS27: =004932
yaaaaaaaaaaaay!
_
57. TN2: =004949
oh hi!
i remember you, you talked to me a lot in my dreams
yup!
thats because my dream self died
pretty catastrophically!
thanks, but i think im ok
i felt pretty shaken up at first though
yeah i have done a lot of sleeping myself :)
wow why did you sleep so much???
oh no what happened that was so terrible?
ok sorry for prying!
what did you want to talk about?
permission for what?
with bec?
uh....
what do you mean by commune?
and
what do you mean the first time!
you did it before?
ohhh
like a psychic power??
pretty sweet!
when did you do it before?
_
58. TN3: =004951
hehe what?
_
59. TN4: =004955
omg......
that wasnt a senior interloper, im pretty sure youre talking about my grandpa!!!
and if im interpreting correctly....
youre saying you used bec to make me shoot him???
augh thats so awful!
oh boy
ok it is basically an old man, who serves the same role as i guess a lusus does on your planet?
he was like my dad, he took care of me!
sigh...
well im not blaming you or anything
it sounds like you were just trying to help
and you did save my life
but......
i mean jeeeez
talk about a misunderstanding
uh
sure?
.... it is?
oh nooo
how did that happen?
:|
ummm what kind of device?
oh you mean a wheelchair!
how...
did that happen?
D:
im so sorry
um also
i didnt realize you were paralyzed
not that im saying sorry for that! that would be rude i think
i am just saying sorry for your loss
oh?
wow nice!
um
that.....
i dont know if i agree with that!
well
thats good i guess
i just wish...
maybe you'd told me what happened when i was younger?
i spent years wondering about it!
when i was REALLY young, i was sure the doll sitting across from him did it
and for a long time i was terrified of the evil blue girl!!!
she sort of haunted my childhood and i had trouble sleeping for a long time
but of course i got older and realized that was silly, but then i just speculated that maybe it was suicide
which was just a really sad thing to think about!!!
buuuut...
even if you do, i dont remember you doing so!
er
ok :\
.......
_
60. TN5: =004956
woooooow...
you sound really confused to me!
heheheh
youre incredibly silly
i cant really tell to what extent youre joking around here!
rufio?
what do you mean fake?
ohh like an imaginary friend....
heh, ok
that
sure is a philosophy you have there!
oh??
well, what is it?
yes
sure!
red feelings?
you mean
whoooooaaaaaa
wait
really? :o
um.................
well
i dont think i can reciprocate!
i mean
youre nice
but i dont really know you...
i dont even know your name!
ok tavros
i dont know if youve fully thought about this!
you dont actually know me very well either
well no
i was being nice
because
i like to be nice to people when i can, and when they are nice to me
but......
things are a little more complicated than that, you cant know someone just by a few conversations!
i mean, i only talked to you when i was asleep! i am kind of different when im dreaming...
i forget things, and at times im not totally sure whats real
dont you remember thats what its like to dream on prospit?
sorry, i feel bad about having to disappoint you...
but i dont know what else to say
jeeeeeez, um...
tavros i am really flattered you like me and all
and that sure is confident of you to say so! and thats great buuuut...
i guess confidence is one thing but there is such a thing as being toooo forward i guess?
i aaaalso think...
and really this is just polite friendly advice!
that if youre really confident you dont always have to say it all the time
it...
oh man im sorry to say
it just comes of as a little insecure and off putting and kind of defeats the purpose!
and all things considered i think we should just stay friends
or really........
continue building a friendship in the first place, since like i said we dont actually know each other that well!
sorry :C
aaaah no! you should have self respect
just...
oh boy this is frustrating
can we talk about this later?
i have some things to do!
why dont we get back to the original point
why do you want to commune with bec again?
_
61. TN6: =004957
uh-ohhh
what is your idea this time?
wow, i dunno about that!
but hes my best friend!!!
and you have already managed to get one of my family members killed
but all of our adversaries have inherited his powers!
i would imagine the strongest guy would have all of his powers, and then some!!!
i am really not comfortable with this
you said you are asking me permission first and i appreciate that
but if you are asking im afraid my answer is no!
what?
no way!
that would be smug and arrogant and would make you a bully!!!
later if my friends and i want to ask bec for help and decide thats our best hope, then thats our business
until then, just please stop meddling!!!!!!
nooooooooo dont dont dont dont dont
im serious
uuuuggghh i think my headache is coming back
no...
its fine
i just really dont want you to do that ok?
i have to go now
bye tavros
_
62. DS28: =005041
it is the prettiest tree i have ever seen!!!!!
ok great!
everything about that makes total sense
ok
_
63. DS29: =005042
is this conksucky enough
<3
well...
i am not even sure if i am technically a u.s. citizen!
_
64. EA1: =005075
which one were you again?
wait
werent you the guy who was always trying to hit on me??
uh...
but
im the wwitch!
i mean witch
rose?
i do not have a score to settle with rose!!!
why would you think that?
i think you are projecting your own attitude on to others
just because you tend to hate and/or hit on everyone you meet doesnt mean everyone else is that way
rose just sent me a code for a crystal ball, shes my friend and is basically the best!
wait do you have a thing for her too???
did she reject you or something?
:|
uh huh...
wow what are you talking about
hey look at that, time for me to get going!
no i dont want it!!!!!
more like a legendary piece of shit!
yes but i dont like you very much and i feel really icky about accepting a present from you
siiigh
fine
what?
oh...
_
65. EA2: =005076
hmmm...
i have seen this before
i am very sure its the same rifle included with johns present
but...
bigger of course
yes but....
i did not provide the weapons!
my penpal did
the guy who helps me build the present
we worked on it together but he supplied the bunnys weapons
im pretty sure hes from the future!
because he said he's my grandson
umm yes
oh no!!!!!
aaaaa please dont tell anyone i told you about him!
augh how could i let that slip to you of all people
wow ok!!!!
i wasnt going to say anything
he didnt want me to tell my friends who he really was
i guess maybe he was concerned about upsetting the timeline? i dunno
maybe!
i have wondered about that, assuming he is right...
he was so nice, and it really did feel like i was talking to family, so i really dont think he was making it up
i couldnt help but try to imagine his parents...
and more interestingly.......
his grandfather :O
i still wonder who it could be...
although i guess at this point
the options are pretty limited :o
like an heirloom? i guess it could be
do you even have those? if you dont have parents how could you?
ewwwwwwww
hmmmm
then maybe that is how this heirloom should work
well i dont want to use it!
so ill just dump it outside the house with the trash
and if it is fated to find my penpal one day then so be it!
maybe you should have been nicer to me!
in any case i dont appreciate the spirit in which the gift was given so this is what i will do!
_
66. DS30: =005104
dave!!!!!!
any dave out there please listen!
dave i just saw you, and you were dead!
you were in a green suit and covered in blood, oh god it was terrible :(
if that was a future dave you have to make sure that doesnt happen!!!
oh
i am confused :o
ok...
i am still not sure i get that!
but i guess i am relieved?
wheeeew! there i just was
how did that poor dave die?
was it jack?
D:
what about your...
um....
oh no i dont even know if you know about this 
;_;
is it something you would like to talk about
ghost dad???
oh...
yes he mentioned something about it
i guess i didn't realize its full implications....
but time was short when we talked!
ugh i forgot i still have to get back to him
its like a big unpleasant chore hanging over my head D:
anyway dave im really sorry about your bro/dad
you were pretty close with him right?
heheh
sure
dave we have to stop him!!!!!
jack!
he shouldnt get away with this
yes
why dont you stop jumping around through time like a maniac and stop being like a hundred daves all the time and come to my house so we can make a plan to kill him??
oh :(
what is the scratch?
really??
hmmmm...
so was that like a hint?
about what im supposed to do :D
well maybe im just being naive...
but a crazy suicide mission does not sound like the ideal solution to me!
are you suuuure we cant beat him?
i dont know if we should rule it out!
ok
thanks dave!
_
67. TN7: =005106
hey tavros!
i was thinking about your plan
about uh...
"communing" with my lusus :)
maybe its not a bad idea!
are you there?
hmm, i guess you are off doing something else
oh well, hope youre doing ok....
talk to you later!
_
68. JadeS1: =005113
hello!
ummmmmm
jade?
can you talk?
oh good!
hehehe, i was starting to get worried there
_
69. JadeS2: =005140
uuugh
what happened?
oh no oh god.....
what did i dooooo
_
70. JadeS3: =005141
um... jade?
what is the matter?
why are you so sad?
i prototyped you and brought you back!
should i not have?
oh no, it is?
:(
thats terrible, im really sorry
i guess i did not think this through
i dont think...
that it can be undone :(
:o
_
71. JadeS4: =005142
well...
now i dont know what to do
i really messed up, i feel so bad
where would you go?
but you cant!
i mean, not just yet, please?
i know you are upset jade
but i did sort of bring you back for a reason
we need your help!
well, all of us here
me and dave and rose and john
D:
what is it now!
what do you mean, how could you forget about john???
but john didnt die!
i saved him
YOU saved him, dont you remember?
you pushed him out of the way of prospits moon at the last minute, and hes ok now!!!
oh nooo jade please dont
:C
_
72. JadeS5: =005143
:(
i know jade i was there too...
these are both our memories!
jade, pleeease...
stop...
you are going to make me cry too, stop it!!!
*sob*
PFFheheh... *sob* hehehehehehe
_
73. JadeS6: =005144
you want me to help you...
die again?
wow...
ok, i know this is my fault
but that is a really hard thing to ask me to do!
even if it was possible the way you are now
i dont think i could go through with it :(
ok ok shhhhh...
jade listen
i never did tell you why i brought you back
and it may be that
if you attempt what i wanted you to do in the first place
god i cant believe im saying this...
but you might end up getting what you want anyway
because it was always going to be risky
well, you remember the guy who destroyed prospit?
shh!!!
anyway, he is the reason i brought you here
he has the same powers you have, making him unbeatable to us...
but maybe not you!
so you could go find him and 
um
i just thought
as long as youre here
but
i thought you wanted to die?
you wouldnt go even if he could....
jeez...
youre right, i really dont
i said SHH!
wow
jade...
i dont mean to be insensitive but
there is a lot at stake here!
i... pfhehe, dont change the subject!
i mean, dont you remember what this was all about?
what you were working for... what WE were working for all those years before you died?
remember what we saw in the clouds, or what the queen told us?
how could you not remember john survived?
we both saw him in a cloud! he was in his dream suit and awake, reading our letter!
didnt you think about that?
...
what!!!!!
how can you SAY that?
JOHN DIDNT DIE!!!
omg...
this is so frustrating, i just told you he didnt
i knew i was kind of ditzy and forgetful in my dreams, but
SHHHHH! okaaaaaay, jeez!
i just dont know what to think
i guess you are part of me, and you are who i was when i slept
but it makes me sad to think i would act like this
i would like to think that even if i was sad and scared, if i was put in a position where everyone depended on me, i could put all those feelings aside and do whats right!
yes you do!
even though you dont want to be, youre here now, and there are still people who need you
there is still something worth fighting for!
_
74. JadeS7: =005145
that is a horrible thing to say!
AUGH!
that is SO SELFISH!!!
i cant believe this
how can you say these things, dont you remember anything that the queen told us?
that we would eventually build a new world and make a future together with our friends?
dont you remember being excited about finding out what that meant?
yes it will!!!
some of us, the ones who still have hope, are fighting for that RIGHT NOW
how can you have such a negative outlook on absolutely everything?
shut up!!!!!!
stop being such a damn crybaby!
really, we both had the EXACT SAME EXPERIENCES. and look, i am managing to keep my head up, see?
you dont even have the full picture either, because you checked out early!
you didnt have to stand by as bec gave jack his powers when you might have been able to stop that
and you didnt have to watch as jack became so strong he could appear anywhere and kill anyone you loved at any moment!
you didnt have to see a dave lying in his own blood :( 
no, see.....
HEY! no. youre not allowed to cry about that because you DIDNT SEE IT
thats the whole point!!!
you are just looking for any excuse you can to be sad and useless and its starting to piss me off!
no
NO. BAD.
NO, FOR GODS SAKE WILL YOU SHUT UP AND PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER, YOU ARE DRIVING ME CRAZY
_
75. JadeS8: =005416
I SAID PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER YOU BLUBBERING GODDAMN PANSY
JUST SHUT UP. DRY YOUR CRYBABY EYES, STOP BEING A COWARD, AND GO FIGHT JACK NOIR!!!!!!!!!!!!
_
76. JadeS9: =005147
SHUT UP
NO
JUST
GOD DAMN IT
PLEASE
JUST ONCE
SHUT THE HELL UP
SHU UP
SHUT
THE
FUCK
UP
_
77. KV5: =005150
karkat!!!!!
yes
im going crazy here
i never thought id say this, but im actually almost relieved to talk to you
or really ANYBODY besides that lunatic
SHE IS DRIVING ME NUTS!!!!!!!
are you joking??? look at this mess!
okay...
i made the mistake of prototyping my dream self who has been dead for years
and shes completely crazy and theres no talking any sense into her
hmm?
hmm what
_
78. KV6: =005151
:\
what are you getting at???
well...
i mean, i understand why she is upset
but she is completely inconsolable, and wont listen to reason about anything!
and i guess i could deal with that but...
the frustrating thing is that shes actually me :(
i really dont think i would act like that
will you stop saying hmm!!!!!!
fascination?
what do you find so fascinating?
my feelings?
well...
at first i was sad
because she made me remember all the sad things that just happened
but im trying to be strong about all that so we can keep moving forward
and if i can then why cant she?
but she just went on and on
and i started getting angry...
ugh i have never been so angry in my LIFE!!!
I SAID STOP SAYING FUCKING HMM
what does THAT mean?????
is that supposed to be someone with a halo and goofy teeth?
ARE YOU MAKING FUN OF ME?
oh
haha oops
yeah, pretty much
considering what??
oh come on...
this is NOTHING like that!
because she's...
well
she's ACTUALLY INSANE
but
those are you
im not her!
i dont know
it just...
...
oh my god
youre right :(
_
79. KV7: =005152
so then i guess
im a hypocrite :(
wait...
so me arguing with my dead dream self
and smacking her around while screaming at her
makes me SANE???
hahaha, wow
you are so weird
you want me to apologize?!
for what, calling you crazy for arguing with yourself???
after taking so much crap from you for all those years?
no forget it, im not apologizing that is BULLSHIT
shut uuuup!!!
what
are you saying you want to apologize
ok, i appreciate the THOUGHT of an apology, but i dont know if it really counts if you are just going to pawn off responsibility on your "past self" again!
maybe your "present self" should own up to it!
laaaaame
hahahaha, that is so ridiculous
why dont you stop it with all this nonsense and own up to being terrible unequivocally?
:o
hmmmm...
yes, hm
ok karkat, that sounds pretty sincere to me
and youre right, i dont actually know you
i just know the part of you who acted like a bully
i understand there can be more to a person than just the stuff they say when theyre angry
so i will accept your apology and give you another chance
and i will apologize for calling you crazy
obviously i am not in much position to judge :|
so you say you have been talking to me from the future?
ok, so what is the plan?
i mean, why did you want me to contact you at this moment so badly?
yes
_
80. KV8: =005153
ok, i can do that
but why, what does it do?
its been here my whole life and i could never figure it out
i dont think im following...
you were told?
by who?
oh...
future me?
uh... ok
well it sounds like a pretty good policy to me!
hey!!!
oh yeah! dave told me about that.
what is it?
ok then...
what was the thing i told you to tell me to do?
ok
then what
draw it?
and then?
_
81. KM1: =005203
password!
I SAID PASSWORD FUCKASS!!!!!
whoops sorry
ive been having too many password arguments with karkat i guess :p
well......
it depends, do you want to have a silly conversation or a serious conversation?
both are!
but a silly conversation mostly doesnt matter or make the timeline more confusing than it needs to be
so we can have one right now if you want
in fact i would say it is coming dangerously close to being one already!
but if it is a serious conversation you want then im afraid i must demand a........
PASSWORD :P
nope!
because i told you
exactly!!!!!!!!!!!
hehehe
yum :B ??????????????????????
hmm, i suppose those are acceptable
to keep the conversations linear!
i gave you a password at the end of our previous conversation
you have to give me that password to start our next conversation
this ensures that past you cant jump ahead into the conversation and mess everything up, like you are trying to do now!
i know, but trust me its better this way :)
i dont know, i have no idea what time you are from!
but you will get it, i gave it to you some time ago at the end of our last conversation
and i have been eagerly awaiting your linear and unconfusing reply ever since!
bye kanaya <3
_
82. KM2: =005205
thanks i think!
what do you mean by pre blackout rose?
umm, ok...
but what do you mean by blackout???
hmm @_@
im doing what you told me to do!
im getting dave to set up that expensive equipment
so i can start doing all that witch of spacey stuff you were telling me about
which i appreciate, since my sprite turned out to be sad and useless, and not very wise at all :(
oh
what is a sylph?
a magical witch???
thats awesome
breeding duties?????
_
83. KM3: =005206
uhhhhhhhhh...
please tell me that doesnt involve what it sounds like!
it sounds like
it involves
a lot of breeding :\
oh
does the equipment we are deploying have anything to do with it?
ok then, thats pretty neat
yeah, whew <_<;
how so?
what is your role?
whoa, cool!
so you are like bugs, like bees or ants or such, but with horns
:o
errr.......
yes 8|
_
84. KM4: =005207
what!
_
85. KM5: =005208
you think so?
i think you can do it!
yes...
didnt you say your lusus was a grub?
thats perfect!
if you were raised by a mother grub, then you are in a great position to raise one yourself
it is like...
a sort of family legacy!
a really cool alien family legacy
_
86. KM6: =005209
dont mention it!
so how does this cloning stuff work?
i want to try anyway!
if you can hold out hope for rebuilding your race in the center of a meteor, then i think i can at least try to get a little cloning done with the time i have left
yes, dave is doing that at the top of this ridiculous tower
didnt you say it needed to be in a warm place?
my house is freezing now
it ran on geothermal power before...
and i guess theres no heat anywhere inside this planet
yes i would like to hear about that later...
but yeah the weather seems just fine out here in the medium!
lets see how dave is doing.....
_
87. KM7: =005211
its...
so small :o
but
clone babies can barely even fit on that thing!
i mean young humans!!!
you know, that we milk producers nurture hatchless within?
then what is the objective?
what am i breeding????
:O
_
88. KM8: =005212
i cant get over how tiny this thing is!
its so cute
so the baby frogs show up on this pad here?
i cant wait to try it
oh
lol
dave just has a lot of funny stuff to say about all this
oh you know, a bunch of silly stuff
theres too much to copy/paste!
here ill save it all to a file and send it to you
hahaha
alright how do i get started!
_
89. KM9: =005214
ok, here is a frog on the screen
on no, is it trapped in ice?
was your planet covered in ice too?
cool!
anyway, i will try to rescue this frog
so i push this button to appearify it?
ok........
_
90. KM10: =005215
oh god, it is still a frogcicle!!!!
this will not do
i dont understand!
but i am intrigued...
ok, that makes sense i think
how can i appearify some frog slime?
so it is like
a sort of backwards frog breeding
clone first, catch later?
_
91. KM11: =005216
ok, i will try this
heheh, look at this handsome guy here, hiding in the woods and being sneaky
he looks frozen solid too
so if i go bother him later, that means if i try to take him now i will only get slime right???
that sounds like fun!!!!!!!
hmmmmm
k hang on while i clone this fella.....
_
92. KM12: =005217
yaaaaaay!!!
i will think of something...
i wont let the poor little guy suffocate!
_
93. KM13: =005218
so i am supposed to wait for him to grow up, and then breed him with other frog paradox clones?
it is?
huh...
so what is the actual purpose of all this breeding?
am i trying to make one really special frog with just the right genetic code or something?
sort of like the ULTIMATE FROG :O
:O
_
94. KM14: =005219
why?
him?
so he is a boy frog?
the speaker?
hehehe
CROOOOOOAK
then the speaker is like a god, but there are a lot of them?
like one for each session, kind of like the kings and queens?
it is pretty catchy...
if i call him that i will be sure to say i mean no offense!
thats good
ok then what?
what do we do after i make this big god froggy?
does it have something to do with the new universe we create?
you said he was a genesis frog
does that mean we bring him into the universe and...
he makes new planets or life or such?
_
95. KM15: =005220
really???
yes i got that!
you mean he is LITERALLY a universe?
but your species is too!
especially karkat, he is incredibly sarcastic
but i dont do that!
i try to say what i mean as much as i can
from what?
haha, you mean from rose?
yeah, rose and dave are like that all the time!
they inculcate that stuff like crazy
so you have been talking to her a lot i guess?
are you best friends now??
why?
oh yeah, because you said she is blacked out?
what the heck does that mean!
yeah, i didnt like the sound of her plan either!
you did???????
yeah! :D
jeez, i hope not...
me too!!!!!
wow kanaya i did not realize how much we had in common
well, it sounds like helping people is something that is in your nature
i can understand that
are you saying rose is reckless and dangerous?
you mean your guardian?
uh oh...
im not sure why, but the sound of that makes me really nervous
she didnt mention anything about this when we talked
but then she seemed preoccupied
yeah, i will!
lol yeah i guess so!
ok, you can go do that, and i guess i will check on rose, but...
theres still so much i want to know!
i want to know more about stoking the forge and breeding the frogs, and about your time on prospit and all that!
yes! <3
if i have cause to?
oh!!!
that reminds me, i was thinking of implementing a system to keep some of these confusing conversations simple and linear
yeah! i guess someone told you?
aaaaa you see??????
you nearly just gave me the idea for the plan in the first place paradoxically from my own future self!!!
i just find that kind of thing annoying for some reason, it doesnt feel right...
i would rather ideas came from the place they actually came from
ok lets put the system in play starting now!
i will give you a password, and you give it to me in the future when you want to pick up this conversation again
the password is...............
CROOOOOOOOOOOAK
it must be in all caps, and must contain precisely ten Os!
whoops!
eleven then :p
kanaya :o
that sounded
just a weeeeeee bit
sarcastic ;D
you are just becoming multicultural, thats all
i think i am learning to be more multicultural through karkat as well
it mostly involves saying fuck a lot
heheheheh, its ok, hes really not so bad
ok! go hatch that orb!
i will be waiting
later!
_
96. JE15: =005315
john!!! :D
wow, finally!
nope!
dave was able to set up as my server player
he is building up my house right now so that we can deploy some equipment up there
yep!
:o
thats ok, i wont tell him about it
well, maybe you can.....
i will try to put in a good word for you B)
im not sure!
something to do with cloning i guess? it serves some purpose in my quest as witch of space
a nice troll named kanaya has been advising me on stuff about that
have you talked to her? 
you should!
a bunch of trolls are not nearly as bad as i thought
even karkat! he has been helping me too... sort of, hehe
oh yeah, he said plenty of stuff like that, but i dont think he ever actually meant it
flying off the handle is part is of his charm in a funny way, once you know that about him
heheheh
shhhhhhhhh
yeah!
hmm what else... theres been so much going on, its been a little hard to keep track of it all!
why dont you tell me what youve been up to first?
..............
whoa :O
john where did you get that nice flying car?????? 
_
97. JE16: =005316
sort of!
she gave me the code, and i made a cool pair of goggles with it
it certainly seems so! what with your fancy magic car
and your chauffeur familiar, i guess?
you did???
:(
hmmmmm...
maybe, but hang on let me try something
yes!
what have you seen?
:O
like what, what did you seeeee?
frogs?
no...
sure does!
nope! but that sounds pretty interesting
i wonder why i would be surrounded by frogs?
hahaha thats true!
i hope i am not planning on putting them in a cauldron or anything o_o
whew!
bluh. yes :|
i prototyped my dead dream self and tried to get her to fight jack
but it turned out to be a BIG MISTAKE
god i cant believe how dumb that idea was, she was an emotional wreck
oh, she went off to cry somewhere else... good riddance!
hehe i guess so 
what!!!!!
_
98. JE17: =005317
oh noooo 
who?
i dont think so!
well if she tricked you into getting killed, then i would have to agree 
what process?
and how are you alive now if you died! john im a little confused
ohhhhhh!
that makes sense
dave had mentioned you reached the god tier
but he did not say what it involved D:
he probably didnt want to make me worried
or that!
but he also said that no one else would do it but you...
actually, now it makes sense that i wouldnt be able to, since my dream self is dead
its too bad really
i wonder what space powers would be like??
oh well 
!!!
youre right...
i suddenly dont know if i want to become a god tier anymore :(
DX
i dont even want to talk about her! she is sad and cowardly.
why dont you tell me about your new friend?
he sure seems to be enjoying that horn!
_
99. JE18: =005318
haha! what is he doing with that! 
probably!
you are just going to have to deal with the fact that you are becoming a famous hero john, and people everywhere will idolize you
:o
thats great! john you have to get that ring from him! 
hmmmmmmmmmm
that is a problem! 
you do? 
and what?
8O 
ok john.....
i trust you
so i will trust in your trust in him
im going to be a supportive piece of shit all day and fall down all this trust!
lol
john, i already found your dad!
_
100. JE19: =005319
yes i found him with my goggles almost right away!
but i didnt want to interrupt you
he is with roses mom
they are in a castle, having some sort of tea party together
they appear to be enjoying each others company!
its quite adorable actually
RED ALERT!!!!!!
AWOOOOOOOOOOOGA!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
durrrr oh really john :p
but really, they make a nice couple and i think it would be great if they got married!
i guess so 
yes they are pretty special 
i dunno
who are they to stand between two youngsters in love? 
yes john, two people must be in love in order to get married
it is one of the rules!
so what do you say john, are you in love with rose?
and if not, are you prepared to fall in love with her? 
wellllll? :D 
i didnt even know karkat made a shipping diagram...
i will have to make him show me 
<_<; 
whaaat... 
i dont know about that!
i clearly need to take a good hard look at this prophetic document
and possibly tell karkat what an idiot he is! 
uh
well, i dont actually know where he is relative to you!
so i dont know if i can give you directions
there might be some way to do that...
these goggles are actually REALLY COMPLICATED!
i will look into it and get back to you
in the meantime, why dont you fly around and keep looking?
at least now you know to look for a castle
and maybe the clouds will give you some more tips!
sure! <3 
later! 
_
101. AM1; AB1; SC1: =005492
ummmmmm hey guys i hope im not interrupting!!!
_
102. AM2; AB2; SC2: =005493
oh no!
i can leave
:o
its ok! i can take another nap later when you guys arent busy...
well...
i have just been enjoying these little naps more and more lately!
each time i go to sleep i meet more new people and learn so much
but i still cant get karkat to take a nap, boy talk about a guy who is anti nap!
seeeeeriously!
he is the douchiest of crabby crabs who ever douched a big douchey crab
but yeah, its been fun, i should really thank feferi again for setting it up so we could meet like this!
yup!
ummm probably in another bubble
but youll find her! maybe during your next nap...
yeah! you were really nice and helpful
i think your outfit looks so cute! i love your wings too
i am not sure :o
what!
_
103. AM3; AB3; SC3: =005495
i am ready!
_
104. AM4; AB4; SC4; KM16: =005496
yay!
_
105. AM5; AB5; SC5; KM17: =005497
wait! before we do...
hi kanaya! it is nice to meet you
you dont like it???
yes i know you told me!
yes but you probably havent yet
not from your perspective..... i could not help but overhear you are asleep now
you told me all about what happened after you woke up!
about how you turned into a vampire
_
106. AM6; AB6; SC6; KM18: =005498
isnt that daves puppet?
:\
bye!
guys why do you have daves puppet?
what is going on here!
_
107. RL7: =005536
rose jeez!!!
finally
you sure seem to be absorbed in whatever youre doing on that computer...
were you talking to someone?
oh no no i dont blame you for not responding!
you must be very upset
are you ok?
um
because
uhhh i figured you would have found out by now but i guess you still dont know? 
about...
johns dad
and.......
your mom :(
rose?
hello???
oh noo :'(
_
108. RL8; DoSc1: =005538
rose please say something
you are making me nervous... 
umm
because you were busy trying to make the best of this situation?
i dont think you should be so hard on yourself about it
john was being john, and you were being you, which i guess meant taking our problems very seriously and putting all your attention on solving them!
and anyway, you and your mom had a much trickier relationship than john and his dad didnt you?
i mean, not that i am saying that means you were any less attached to her than him...
argh, i dont know if im very good at consoling people. sorry rose i dont want to make you feel worse :(
whew, ok
you know...
now we have all lost guardians
dave lost his, and i lost mine in a weird way... uuum even though that was pretty much definitely my fault :\
and even the trolls all lost their monster guardians
i think that maybe it is an inevitable part of a game that can be cruel sometimes 
......
i am so sad
rose i think you are being stronger about it than i am
oh
well
i just hope you arent thinking of doing something rash
yeaaah...
errrr, i dont know?
wellllll
no!
but i was trusting that you had thought it through and it was our best hope
hm
then what will you do?
what does that mean!
oh no no no no no!
rose that is a much much worse plan!!!!!
he would probably kill you!
i know what you mean, i was angry at jack and wanted to stop him too, but we have to think of a more sensible way to do it
what? who?
aaaaaaa whaaaaat?????
rose who is this!
i dont even know whats going on anymore
SHHHHHHHHHH!
please dont rose, i know you are angry but you arent thinking straight
nooo :(
rose, maybe white text guy is right?
the dark gods gave you all these powers, and seem to be helping us with dream bubbles and stuff...
but what if they are not actually good?
no...
but i still dont trust them!
whats this weirdo talking about!
oh yeah
i noticed you found it!
 i was worried it had been destroyed when my room blew up
is he saying you can use it?
omg
does it work???
then maybe you should try it!
well
since we dont know much about the gods...
why dont you ask it about them?
i guess that is a way to put it
_
109. JE20: =005589
john!!! i am worried about rose!
im pretty sure she is on her way there to look for jack!
i cant say for sure because i cant see her with my goggles anymore for some reason, but i am fearing the worst
just in case, you should to try to intercept her before she does something stupid like try to fight him!!!!!
also, um...
i guess you probably still dont know about your dad yet do you?
darn, why do i always have to be the one to break terrible news :(
er
john?
_
110. JE21: =005590
oh god please dont tell me your computer was in the wallet you just gave that guy.....
dammit john!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
one of these days you will learn the value of having plenty of backup computers
in fact whenever you finally leave the battlefield i am going to give you the code for a nice pair of lunchmuffs
and then i am going to force you to keep them on your head AT ALL TIMES!
yeah, youre never going to read this are you :|
_
111. KV9: =005872
pw.
listen fuckass
i am going to need a password before we continue
plz <3
....................... :|
no karkat, that was not quite the password
but you were on the right track :p
youre being deliberately dumb
it was...
IF I HATE MYSELF SO MUCH, THEN WHY DON'T I HATEMARRY MYSELF?
remember?
i was just using the password system to poke a little fun at you, and you turn it into this whole overdramatic thing, jeeeeez.
_
112. KV10: =005873
i wonder if we will ever be able to start a conversation without having a ridiculous argument about the password system?
why would i want to do that??
the only guy whos dumber than past karkat is future karkat, and vice versa!
i have this on good authority from both sources
you see, that is your problem
okay, one of your many, many problems...
you have no patience to do things the right way, youre always just looking for the shortcut!
even if doing so has brought you nothing but trouble a hundred times before
it is sort of funny that the only thing standing in your way is one of your other problems, your preposterous self loathing
so you cant even trust your future self to help you cheat!
its like you have so many problems, they cancel each other out
exactly :D
ok
yes
yes, we still are!
this little detour was related to that task. we should be nearly done.
i can understand her just fine!
we already talked about this
echidna and i have an understanding now ;) 
well maybe if you werent in such a grumpy hurry all the time you wouldnt have killed your denizen so quickly
you might have actually learned something!!!!!!
did you ever talk to kanaya about it?
her situation was very similar to mine
it doesnt sound like you got the whole story
or maybe you just werent listening to her :p
this was kanayas suggestion
yes!
im talking to her right now actually
durrr, of course not, shes from a different time than you genius 
a few hours in your future!
you are so ridiculous, i have kanaya using the same password system as you
she is just a little further ahead on my timeline is all
it would be pretty hard to keep you both synced up!
yeah, from MY future, i dont want you guys telling me the things i do before i do them because you talked to future me!
but knowing a few things about your future doesnt really matter, NOT that i am going to tell you any of it, so dont ask
siiign, what are you even talking about?
aw
well...
youll find him
i know, i made an exception
but only one!
kanaya thinks we should all talk about this
she says youre important to consult on the matter, but the you from her time is too busy
:x!!!!!
she is opening a memo
_
113. KV11: =005875
yeah...
its ok though. as long as he is tailing me like a lost puppy, at least hes not killing anybody
i remember the episode!!!
but hes ok now
and im kind of starting to think that was just his way of saying hi
my dog used to fetch my bullets too!
i really think he believes he is my dog, on some level
dont worry, im keeping my eye on him
aaaaaa no no no, bad jack, bad!!!!!!
_
114. KV12; KM19: =005876
yeah...
the poor froggies :(
youre probably right, they really seem to drive him crazy
this is not the first time i have had to reprimand him
he was growling at echidna and i had to tell him he was being very bad
he destroyed some of her really nice statues too
keeping him in line really makes me miss bec, he was such a good dog
not to mention a best friend
jack is just...
exactly
huh?
_
115. KV13; KM20: =005877
but you are a programmer arent you? that is at least kind of like being a scientist, having some technical savvy...
we know! you are clearly very good at being all of those things
but now we need your help with frog science. can you help us?
_
116. KV14; KM21: =005678
shhhhhhhshhhshhshshsh.....
SHOOSH
no future talk!!! lets stay on topic
kanaya means she is a very pretty girl with pointy fangs who has a bright sunny complexion and wears fancy dresses
and...
she drinks blood >_>
hee hee
yup :)
karkat...
that information qualifies as..........
FUTURE STUFF!
no wait! just please listen a little longer? 
_
117. KV15; KM22: =005679
not exactly...
she just helped me remember
something from my past
if i accepted her terms
yeah because you never told me yours!!!
hmm
yeah she made me promise to do something that sounds impossible too
except......
i actually agreed :o
i have no idea how im going to keep my side of the bargain, now that i think about it
oh right
where the last frog is!
or was...
the thing is
the frog we need is nowhere to be found in the medium
it was on earth!
but only very briefly
it was when i was young
before i woke up on prospit
i had begun sleep walking
both on the island and on the moon
and in my dream it was very bright
i saw something in the light
i couldnt tell what it was so i got closer
_
118. KV16; KM23: =005880
but before i got there i woke up
and found myself by the lagoon surrounding the ruins
_
119. KV17; KM24: =005881
i was about to walk home
when i saw something appear on a lily pad
it was a frog!
an amazing shiny frog, not like any other ive seen in the lagoon
_
120. KV18; KM25: =005882
it hopped over to me and i picked it up
but then, just like that...
_
121. KV19; KM26: =005883
it died
_
122. KV20; KM27: =005884
later my grandpa made a robot for me to help me with my sleep walking
it could do all the walking while i stayed safe in bed!
it could also record my dreams
i am sure he always knew my dreams were going to be special
i suspect he knew it before i was even born
_
123. KV21; KM28: =005885
hopefully!
no, it completely slipped my mind
well, like it was before
the choices she gives you seem to have to do with facing mortality
and making it clear if you choose one path over another it will lead to your death
and that your death may even be necessary to accomplish a goal
yeah
but
that is not really what made this hard
i mean
nobody wants to die of course
but at least...
that is a clear thing
you either do you you dont
you know?
it might be
she said
that if i accepted her help
that i would have to make a promise
that whenever we left this place
and wherever we end up going
she had to come
not just echidna but all the denizens
their palaces their consorts their lands...
everything
i have to bring them all with us
_
124. KV22: =006001
oh sorry!
i was distracted
no not by all the scratchy stuff in the sky
theres something coming down...
_
125. KV23: =006002
its hard to make out
but
i think
it might be...
_
126. KV24: =006003
shaving cream?
_
127. KV25: =006004
its like
hey!
...
karkat?
_
Act 6
_
Act 6 Intermission 1
_
128. JE21: =006196
im not sure!
some sort of limbo dimension between the two walls i guess
like a realm with unusual spatial properties we have to cross through
yes!
we still totally exist john
_
129. JE22: =006197
about what?
yes
i didnt make it with witch powers though, i captchalogued it hours ago because karkat told me to...
then at the last minute i took it out and made it huge so we could escape through it
i did make it huge with witch powers!
they also make things small
yup
also
witch powers can teleport things, and fling things around through space at very high velocities
all sorts of stuff!
but to be honest, im not sure how much of that is attributable to inheriting becs abilities... 
yes that was the basic idea
that would be jake
and yeah, i do believe we will meet him in this session
he said he had a bunch of friends who helped him make the bunny! im pretty excited to meet them all 
actually, they both went, and in a manner of speaking, their mission was a success 
nope!
they did not actually destroy the sun. trust me, i would know if it was gone. now that i know what i know, it was kind of silly of us to think it would ever be destroyed...
and as it happens, rose and dave are not dead either! i have received very reliable reports that they survived 
it will all be more clear soon 
ive learned a lot in my dreams lately
heh, probably more than i ever learned looking at the clouds on prospit!
when i was dead there for a few minutes, i had one last very informative nap
the bottom line is, rose and dave will rendezvous with the trolls near the green sun, and then they will all meet us in the new session 
_
130. JE23: =006198
its through the other wall!
yes
no, not lawn ring!
thats a silly troll word
its the yellow yard
we have to cross it to break through the next wall
see that long yellow band down there, stretching between the two walls?
i think thats supposed to be the yard
hmmm
yeah i think youre right
kinda like the yellow brick road?
hehe
_
131. JE24: =006200
:|
i have no idea
extra dimensional shenanigan based phenomena perhaps?????
_
132. JE25: =006202
i dont know!
:?
yes me too
hmmmmmm
_
133. JE26: =006204
im just trying to estimate our arrival time
based on our current velocity, which is about as close to light speed as i can make it go 
hmmmmmmmmmmm...
no
itll take quite a bit longer than that 
i would say
if i keep our speed constant...
we should arrive in about three years
_
134. JE27: =006205
i know!
i cant!
not here, at least
the way i understand it is...
becs powers draw from the green sun
and the green sun presides over our universe
many universes actually! and the sessions that created them, as well as the sessions created within them
including the trolls universe and their session
think of it like a giant solar system, but instead of planets revolving around the sun, there are many universes 
it is!
so, bec was able to teleport anywhere in the universe he wanted in an instant, much faster than light
jack was able to do this too, within our session, and then when i inherited those powers from jadesprite, so could i
but we could only teleport locally
which means, bec could jump to anywhere in our universe, but not to another universe, or into a session
and jack could jump to anywhere in our session, but not outside it
we cant even jump to the green sun itself, even though we sort of serve as a gateway to it, and all its energy
and once we leave the suns domain, our travel is limited by the speed of light, like everyone else!
for example, the furthest ring is not in the suns domain
it is more like the suns medium, allowing it to exist
so if i wanted to fly out of our session and travel to the green sun, i would have to make my way there through the furthest ring at the speed of light or less
and wherever we are now is not in the suns domain either
so the same rules apply
yes i think youre right
but to be fair, we were all the victims of a big prank! 
some really creepy omniscient guy
it doesnt matter much, hes supposedly dead now
yes, but its not all as bad as it seems
theres a silver lining in all of this
like you said, a sun presiding over many universes has to be pretty cosmically important
who knows what terrible consequences there would be if it was destroyed
or maybe worse, if it never existed at all
which is what made rose and daves true mission an unintended success! 
to deliver the bomb to the empty location the green sun was meant to exist for most of eternity
and then create the sun in the first place
that is what the tumor was for all along 
like i said
we got played like a bunch of suckers!!!
_
135. JE28: =006236
i think he looks cool!!!!!
the cape is great, hes like a super hero now 
yup
...
:(
!!!
........... 
how did you know about that!
oh
that figures
umm
yeah
i dunno
do you want it to come true?
hmmmmmm.....
i think i miss them already
and weve only been here for a few minutes :(
well
you could ask them now if you want
_
136. JE29: =006237
yes
in fact
you can hop right through me and join them
then you can travel with them to the new session if you like
it probably would!
but i cant go with you
i can serve as a gateway
but i cant travel to the sun myself, remember?
but its ok, really!
if thats what you wanted to do, i wouldnt mind
but whatever you do, you have to decide quickly
they will be departing from the sun very soon 
i wouldnt really be alone though
_
137. JE30: =006238
i have the population of five planets to keep me company! 
awww :D
ok then
personally, i think this trip could be a lot of fun!
theres no pressure to do anything important or run around like lunatics anymore
we can just relax 
woof!
whoops
there should be lots of good stuff on the planets
also i would bet this ship is stocked with plenty of military rations
oh yeah!!!
durrr, problem solved
yes
im pretty sure she knows a ton of things now
considering she is a fully realized seer of light 
im sure that would be hilarious
but
if you go i dont think i can bring you back
i cant bring anyone or anything to here from there! 
as far as i know...
if theres a way i havent figured it out yet
i am still kind of new to this omnipotence thing after all :\ 
i dont know!
im sure the rules exist for a good reason though
maybe to somewhat limit the power and reach of omnipotent beings?
if there are no limits at all, it could be especially dangerous in the wrong hands
like what happened with jack!
then i guess thats what we are!
semipotent demigods
woof woof woof!
dammit!!!!!! 
i havent gotten the hang of the woofs yet :( 
i think so
i do too!

140. JE33: =006241

_
141. JE34: =006242

whatever you write just make it quick!
and tell everyone i say hi!
ok, while you work on that, i think ill bring up some friends
you know, let some of our travel companions get acquainted with the ship!
_
142. JE35: =006243
shooooooooosh!!!!!
write now, catch up later!

143. JE36; DaSp1: =006244

john i really think we are scraping the bottom of the barrel here
thats sort of my point!
where did you even get this?
:|
_
145. JE38: =006630
i dont really think this is my kind of game....
but i will play it with you today because it is technically your birthday <3
how many people did you get to play this??
why cant you cross the streams?
:p
_
146. JE39: =006631
im working on it!
there are so many options
what kind of ghostbuster should i make?
hmmmm 
what do you have to do?
noooooooooo! 
sure john
whatever you say
are you serious?
what about that fire pole there?
cant you go down the fire pole? 
......... 
yeah i think im done!!!
im pretty happy with him
_
147. JE40: =006632
no way!
hes adorable, what are you even talking about?
i dont want ghosts to be afraid of him
i want to make friends with some ghosts if at all possible 
nope. im keeping him :p
shut up or ill give him a pink jumpsuit!
i think i will manage to survive the embarrassment in front of a bunch of salamanders and crocodiles 
thank you
*snicker* 
nothing
hehe
pffff!
its davesprite, hes playing too
we have strategies?
hahahahahahaha 
did you know...
davesprite is a funny guy?
i just told him you said that 
davesprite says to tell you "youre basically welcome for being born 14 years ago and 1 year ago you ungrateful douche" 
um
because he is davesprite? 
well yeah
but hes kinda different from dave
i know
but there are other differences...
_
148. JE41: =006633
its hard to explain
just some slight differences in personality i guess 
yes...
so?
ok i will admit i cant really tell if his rapping style has changed 
i dont know if the differences are because he is a sprite
or because he lived for a while in a different timeline... 
i wasnt a sprite!
my dead dream self was a sprite
and then i kind of merged with her when i became a god tier 
i guess?
its more like im still the me i always was, but inherited some of her memories
but they are pretty vague 
i remember being dead for a long time
and making friends...
mostly trolls 
none that we know of now
that i can remember at least
they feel like such distant memories, like they were barely real 
yeah me too
maybe its something about this place were traveling through? 
when was the last time you visited one in your sleep?
yeah
yup
_
149. JE42: =006634
nope :(
i dont think thats it
for one thing, considering where we are, i dont think theres such a thing as "the same time" for us
maybe...
but its probably more like the way it used to be with the clouds in skaia
they didnt always show you things, but when they did they were selective about what they would let you see
like they would make sure you saw whatever you needed to see to make sure things would go the right way
i always thought i knew so much, but in retrospect they gave me only a tiny glimpse of the big picture! 
i guess!
it never felt that way when all i was doing was looking up at some clouds
i was happy to see whatever was there
but i guess its different in a situation like this
when you miss your friends, and you kind of wish the dream bubbles would play along 
_
150. JE43: =006635
heheh, probably!
hmmm
well look at it this way
by the end of our trip, will YOU be better friends with a bunch of salamanders than you are with rose and dave? 
that is true
umm
what do you mean the way things are going?
what!
what has he been telling you??
well...
i guess i dont know whats going on with that
i really dont!!!
um
what
do you think he would think about that?
the other dave
i mean
hypothetically
im only wondering because you brought it up!!!!!! 
then what do you think?
maybe
well
what about you john? 
_
151. JE44: =006636
remember how you told me how karkat kept sort of trying to set you up with rose?
you told me this on more than one occasion if i recall!
well, i have kind of wondered to myself if you kept bringing that up because on some level you wanted that to be true...
not at all! that is perfectly fine
aww
heheheheh
what?
*snicker*
i guess you have a point
mm hm
yikes
.....
that was just my hunch
i sincerely doubt it
at least
i hope not ._.
that is so outrageous
after you!

whaaat
but you love this movie!
but you were making such a big deal about finally getting me to watch it with you on your birthday!
you were going on and on about how i wouldnt be disappointed... but now youre saying you dont like it?
really?
i was actually kind of enjoying it!
its very silly
i really dont think its the kind of movie youre supposed to take all that seriously john
i dunno....
but people can change their minds about things
i think youre allowed to change your mind about a silly movie
i used to LOVE the squiddles show when i was really young
but as i got older i started to realize it wasnt as great as i thought it was
i was just too young to see how it was actually a flagrant vehicle for selling merchandise
and if you believed the conspiracy theorists it might have even been pushing some other dark hidden agendas.....
so i stopped liking the show itself as much but that didnt change the fact that i had a lot of fond memories about it
i still loved all the cute characters and could enjoy it on a nostalgic level
what is even the problem with it?
ive just been watching this and thinking, yup, i can see why john was so obsessed with this movie...
its funny!
_
157. JE50: =007189
but he was trying to sound like a hardened criminal to win the trust of john malkovich!
what!!
you spent your whole life worshiping this dumb movie and now youre calling ME naive????
oh god
vexing and hypnotic??
its a movie full of explosions about a guy with a mullet
what is with you lately? you seem to be in such a crappy mood these days
oh bluh bluh
can we just finish the rest of the movie?
_
158. JE51: =007190
look you made us miss a whole bunch of stuff!
hang on im going to rewind it...
whos dave chappelle?
no!!!
dont touch the remote
YES :p
john you are kind of sounding like a crazy person here
what???
_
159. JE52: =007191
oh...
heh
yeah
why do you always call him dave sprite?
no, i mean why do you always say it like that? with the space between words?
its not dave sprite, its just davesprite
yeah.... john
i dont think davesprite is coming tonight
_
160. JE53: =007192
no...
it has nothing to do with jaspers
he uh...
kind of broke up with me
_
161. JE54: =007193
a couple days ago
john its ok you dont have t...
we were?
your rock??
what are you talking about?
we were not an institution!
you are just saying meaningless things now
um...
its complicated
basically hes just going through a lot of stuff right now
do uh...
you have a girlfriend?
i dont think hes a douche, hes just...
_
162. JE55: =007194
i dont think being a bird ever bothered him
like i said... its all more complicated than that
me too
why?
i dont know
what do you mean
uh
so
SO WHAT IF HE HAS A GHOST BUTT!!!!!
WHATEVER YOURE JUST SAYING, JUST STOP SAYING IT!
and whatever youre trying to gesture with your hands there, stop doing that too!
nope!!! totally not talking about this
put your hands down john
_
163. JE56: =007195
thats not down, thats up!
oh well, at least youre not making those unsettling gestures...
john...
what are you doing?
i hope youre not entertaining some awkward train of thought about, uh...
what is with you??
today is your birthday, youre supposed to be having fun!
but youve been so testy, as if youre committed to not having a good time
yeah, i can see how you might find it a little slow here
i dunno, i havent minded much... maybe its different for me though because i used to live all alone?
but i dont mind doing that any time!!!
john... if you told me this earlier i would have...
were already going as fast as i can make us go
about the speed of light!
no! nothing can go faster than light john
unless you teleport of course
i already explained this! i cant do that here, its not within the domain of the green sun which gives me those powers!
no thats just a regular law of physics!!! jeez
ok first of all, thats not even close to the speed of light
light travels at a hundred and eighty six thousand miles per second no matter what frame of reference youre in... even this one!
second of all special relativity and comparing laws of physics between different frames of reference, those are tricky issues to talk about!
but id be more than happy to talk about them if youd like. actually i would enjoy that because i never really get to talk about science wi...
yes as a matter of fact it is!
you take that back!!!!!
john.....
what is that?
_
164. JE57: =007196
under your hood...
looks like a piece of paper stuck to your back?
_
165. JE58: =007199
what?
what is it??
_
166. JE59: =007200
where are you going?
what! john, no....
_
167. JE60: =007201
ok yes, that practical joke is in poor taste, but you should try to calm down and...
um
which one?
sigh
_
168. JE61: =007202

_
169. JE62: =007204

wasnt i supposed to be the mule?
i dont think i understand your analogy
....
_
171. JE64: =007206
john i think youre officially throwing a tantrum here

john?

ummm
not really :\
_
180. Ce4: =008616
i wish i could tell you
but im still drawing a blank on everything!
i dont even remember what i was doing when i fell asleep
or even
IF im sleeping
er...
how are you supposed to tell if youre a ghost or not?
darn
what?
anti sleeping magics?
i mean majyyks?
what reasons?
aw
thats ok im in no hurry to go yet
or for that matter, to remember why im here
i cant put my finger on it
but i have this awful feeling something bad happened
specifically something that happened because of me
yeah :(
im worried i may have done some things i wouldnt be proud of
that maybe i could have even...
hurt some people
i hope its just my imagination
in any case i feel like i could use some rest
and you seem very nice
so id rather relax here with you for a while than jump right back into...
whatever craziness is waiting for me out there
by the way, i didnt catch your name...
your trollsona?
nice to meet you too callie :)
but
what is a trollsona?
oh
OH!
i get it... you are not really a troll?
omg she is so cute
or i should say
YOU are so cute!
what a good idea
do you think i could make a trollsona too?
sure!
the BEST color obviously
which is green, DUH :p
wow really??
thats perfect
our trollsonas can be like
blood sisters or such
i dont know enough about troll culture to use proper terminology...
but lets just say thats what we are
what should my horns look like?
oh and for that matter
should i have horns instead of my dog ears, or in addition to them?
ok
hmm where would they go though...
jeez i think we might need to do some drawings to make her look right
_
181. Ce5: =008617
callie...
there is something very familiar about you
are you sure weve never met before?
but you did know my name...
hmmm
i cant shake the feeling that we have spoken before
maybe in an old dream i cant remember?
im not sure if its the sound of your voice or what
i dont recognize your face, but then thats not what you really look like is it?
...
thats fine!
its not a big deal
if its true that weve met before, im sure ill remember in due time
lets not worry about it for now
by the way
what is with this stage?
is it from one of your memories?
i dont think so
it would seem to be some sort of imaginary figment that turned into a real object
i wonder why it looks like a drawing?
hey why dont you come up here and help me get these curtains open
since its the only thing weve got in this boring vortex we might as well try to have a little fun!

it looked more realistic when i lived here
_
183. Ce7: =008910
foliage?
huh!
thats interesting
ummm
heheh yeah i guess not
you havent?
:O
that sounds terrible!
when i was a kid i grew up with plants all around me
but i was very lucky... i guess i took all the nice things about my life on this island for granted
i even had my own garden where i grew flowers and vegetables and fruits and such
that is all i ever ate, the things i grew myself
but i will admit to having developed a taste for meat since becoming a dog <_<;
:o
_
184. Ce8: =008911
my grandpa set it up for me in the atrium
i would spend hours tending to my plants and playing music for them
it was one of the places where i was the happiest i can remember being
i miss that garden
it blew up
and then i built my house waaaay up, on top of where it used to be
in the years since that happened i thought about rebuilding it
as a way to pass the time on my long lonely journey...
but i was too depressed to grow anything
what sort of place did you grow up in that didnt have plants?
was it a desert?
???
that sounds lonely
but didnt you say meat was left for "us" earlier
was someone else there?
who?
oh!
i had a brother too
its funny we keep discovering ways that we are alike
_
185. Ce9: =008913
this is where you and your brother lived? 
_
186. Ce10: =008916
callie...
_
187. Ce11: =008917
when you said you were a monster...
what did you mean?
were you just being hard on yourself...
or did you mean that literally?
i see
and your brother looks the same way too i take it?
was this his tooth?
thats ok, we dont have to talk about it
its just
seeing this tooth
and listening to your voice...
i think im finally starting to remember something
i remember
you!
_
188. Ce12: =008918
yes
im quite sure now that we met once before while i was asleep
it was you, and yet...
it wasnt
i think so
i was a little scared at first actually
but it was not so much because of what you looked like
your voice was the same
and i can tell now that you are basically the same person she was
yet...
you seemed so different
so much more
serious
also...
you were a god tier!
_
189. Ce13: =008919
what do you think it means callie?
if that was you... but not QUITE you... then who was it?
i see
an alternate universe version of yourself?
that makes sense
no wonder she was so...
well
no offense to her, but you are much friendlier :)
not really...
it was not long at all before i could tell she was good
actually, the more i think about it, the more im starting to remember about the encounter
she had a lot to say
she mainly told me stories!
she seemed to really like telling stories
so i think your personality must have been in there somewhere :D
you want to know if i remember any?
yes, its been coming back to me little by little
i think i can retell some of them
hey i have an idea
why dont you help me?
do you have anything to write on?
a pad of paper or such?
_
190. Ce14: =008920
perfect!
ok, i will write the words, and you can draw the pictures
yes
ok where to begin
if i recall...
the first story was about how she defeated her brother
but i dont remember much about that one
and maybe you dont even want to hear a story that has to do with him?
hmm
that makes sense
the rest of her stories i think were meant to account for the differences in the way her life went
:)
so she went on to tell another story
not one about your brother
but one about mine
well
not exactly...
_
191. Ce15: =008921
this is the story about how he died
_
192. Ce16: =008959
im starting to remember the things she told me so vividly now
its amazing what a creative project can do to get your mind turning
the land of wind and shade!
that is where the story starts
hmmm
both, as a matter of fact
my story began with a tragedy on lowas, which led to meeting her in the first place
and then, she used my memory of that tragedy as a starting point for her story, which turned out to be related
(i know)
ill start with mine, since that will make everything else make sense
so go ahead and start drawing
lowas!!
_
193. Ce17: =008960
looks good!
dont forget to put a really tall house poking out of the top
_
194. Ce18: =008961
nothing yet... ill get to that!
but yes, the tragedy is why i was alone on the golden ship
it was not long after our three year journey began
_
195. Ce19: =008962
i was relaxing in our makeshift livingroom, giving john and davesprite some space to themselves for a while so they could catch up
john wanted to visit his home again
so i happily obliged and shrunk them both down so they could hang out in his tiny tall house
it seemed like the nice thing to do...
but i came to regret that decision more than any ive ever made
i was minding my own business when out of nowhere...
_
196. Ce20: =008963
lowas exploded!!!
_
197. Ce21: =008964
i couldnt believe it
it was totally inexplicable
there was no trace of them at all... they were both dead
i supposed it must have meant johns death was heroic... but i couldnt for the life of me imagine how
to me it was as pointless and arbitrary as a death could be
_
198. Ce22: =008965
i looked within myself as hard as i could to see if there was some power i had, in all my omnipotence, to bring them back
but i couldnt
they were gone
i would spend the next three years on that ship without my two best friends
sure, there were still consorts and chess guys to keep me company
but the loss was too much for me to bear
i felt so alone
_
199. Ce23: =008966
weeks and months went by...
i didnt have the slightest sense of how quickly or slowly time was passing
any sense of purpose to reaching the destination had vanished, and delicious though it was, no amount of nannas cake would bring me comfort
toward the end of the journey, when i feeling particularly despondent...
_
200. Ce24: =008967
i fell asleep and had a dream
and that is when i met a very powerful, strangely charismatic creature...
her name was calliope ;)
_
201. Ce25: =008968
as i said, she was somewhat like you, and yet so unalike
her presence was so serious and grave
her hollow eyes were piercing... but not hostile
but the prevailing sense i got from her was one of loneliness
before she even said a word, i could feel it somehow, that this was a deeply lonely soul
until i met her, i thought i was the loneliest person in the universe
but a feeling told me she had been here by herself for a long long time
i felt sorry for her
and relating to her plight helped me overcome the feelings of intimidation
so we began to talk
we traded stories about ourselves
she spoke of the brother she killed
i spoke of the brother i lost
and when i mentioned johns death
that is when she became very serious again
she began to recount how john had died, repeating to me the same story i just told you
she described the spontaneous destruction of lowas which left me alone for years
i wondered why she was recounting this tragedy that happened to me, and for that matter how she knew of it herself
she went on to say that lowas was destroyed because johns denizen had suddenly woken up
typheus, a great monster of truly terrifying power
she said he had destroyed his land and slayed his own heir of breath not out of malice, but to make a slight correction
i asked her...
what do you mean, "correction"?
_
202. Ce26: =008969
she said that the john from my reality, and his entire planet, needed to be erased
and that the slumbering denizen in all his mysterious wisdom knew this
she told me that the dreams of a denizen draw from the same well of potential from which every conceivable possibility arises
the same place skaia gets its power from
so if an agreement with a denizen is reached in one reality, that same denizen in another reality could become aware of it, and respond accordingly
it seems that john, somewhere, in some other plane of existence, had made just such an agreement
she said that the john i knew, like herself, was only one version of a person
there was a different version of john from another reality poised to play a more significant role
you see, the john from that reality in an act of desperation had gone to see typheus, and struck a bargain with him
she would go on to explain the nature of that bargain in the next part of her story
but from my perspective, the consequence of this bargain was to lose my friends, and to live with that for years without understanding why
losing them still hurt, but i was so relieved to at least understand the reason, and to realize their senseless deaths were actually serving a bigger purpose
i thanked her for letting me know
_
203. Ce27: =008970
she told me she was not human, and had no frame of reference for empathizing with my feelings
but if there was one thing she could relate to, it was the feeling of being alone
the feeling of waiting for what seems like eternity by yourself, until finally your purpose presents itself
....
_
204. Ce28: =008971
heh
what?
never what?
i have no idea
could be!
i dont know enough about cherub rites of passage to say either way
human rites of passage either, for that matter
right! anyway...
thats when she began her story in earnest
the one she summoned me in my dreams to tell me
the story of the other john who made a deal with typheus
it began with the same place mine did
lowas
...
so, go on
draw lowas again!
ummmmmm
no, you can just copy the first one you did :)
_
205. Ce29: =008972
yes, but...
there are also supposed to be glitches around
like computery glitches i think
ok why dont we not worry about showing the glitches for this story
they would just make it harder to see whats going on...
which is probably the point now that i think about it?
i never thought much about it
it just seemed like a weird detail she mentioned
but i guess it was some strange form of corruption in their session that made everything harder to understand
no idea!
i guess it was just one more way everything got messed up for them
like, just another surreal obstacle for a hero to overcome?
oh, that reminds me
you need to draw john there as well!
_
206. Ce30: =008973
:)
when she mentioned that i didnt give it a second thought
but now that i am trying to reconstruct everything and tell you what to draw...
hmm
i guess when youre trying to tell a story it forces you to think a lot more about everything than when youre just listening to one
let me think...
hmm, maybe we should pause before i go on?
like
some sort of intermission
so i can collect my thoughts a bit, and to give the audience a little breather between two significant arcs
we were at it for a pretty good while there, after all
well, that would be you in this case
ooh i know!
i can doodle a quick story about the antics of the silly consorts on the golden ship before moving on
_
207. Ce31: =008974
one of the things i did to pass the time on the ship was give them funny names
lets meet our cast of characters for this intermission shall we?
lets see, there waaaas

huh?

209. Ce33: =008976
wow, ok sorry!!!!!
yes youre right this is a stupid diversion... lets continue
um callie...
your hand :o
_
210. Ce34: =008978
so... anyway
like i said, she just finished telling me that she was able to beat her brother in this reality
but apparently, that wasnt supposed to happen?
so she lived out the rest of her life in a doomed timeline and eventually died
she didnt mention how
and then...
and then she did this kinda fancy transition
darn, i dont think ill do it justice
a transition to a story about MY brother... who was stuck in a doomed timeline too
i think ill mess it up if i try to match what she said word for word
she had a really fanciful way of putting things
ok
so the bottom line was
almost all our friends had died
and johns only hope was to return to his planet, and attempt to complete his personal quest
_
211. Ce35: =008979
as you know, we all have personal quests that are unique to our planets
the nature of the quest is never easy to understand at first
they are presented to us through enigmatic riddles conveyed through the lore of the land
for john it was to journey to the place where "constellations danced beneath the clouds"
it was said the heir of breath was to free the stars from the shade and release them into heaven
this was just a mysterious way of saying what he REALLY had to do
_
212. Ce36: =008980
the stars were actually fireflies
theyd been flying around trapped beneath the overcast sky ever since john first brought lowas into existence by his arrival
and paradoxically, theyd been imprisoned there for ages even before that
such is the way of our lands
they are newly born the day we arrive...
and yet they always were
_
213. Ce37: =008981
to free the fireflies john would have to play a special song
it had to be played just right to summon the breeze through the pipes
but there was a problem...
_
214. Ce38: =008982
the pipes were all clogged with oil!
the first day john came to his land, oil began oozing up from the core, flooding the pipes and filling the oceans
to play the song, first he would need to clean up the oil
and to do that, he would need to face the slumbering one himself
he would need to face typheus
_
215. Ce39: =008983
but as he wandered through the catacombs down to the planets core
he wasnt thinking about freeing fireflies or cleaning up oil
he was seeking the help of his denizen to master a power he couldnt control
luckily for him, denizens always seem to understand what you want
and more importantly, what you need, whether you know it or not
_
216. Ce40: =008984
...
is something wrong callie?
go ahead and draw typheus!
you do know what he looks like dont you?
it doesnt have to be perfect
just draw a big green snake monster!
yes
a snake monster with the most unspeakably hideous face you can imagine
but you dont have to be too literal about that
feel free to draw something a little more representational :)
why not?
thats ok
why dont i draw it?
ok but i dont see whats so indecent about a big old snake!
lol
_
217. Ce41: =008986
when john got to the core he arrived to find typheus awake and ready for him
he was then presented with the choice
stop, youre gonna make me crack up too!
this part is serious!!
_
218. Ce42: =008986
his choice was presented as a kind of riddle
spoken in a language only he could understand, spelling out the conditions he must accept
but speaking from experience, once a player is given the choice between two courses of action, it will hardly feel like a choice at all
if the heart is in the right place then the right thing to do always seems obvious
so john accepted his denizens terms
and with that...
_
219. Ce43: =008987
typheus opened valves to the core
and flooded it with oil!
_
220. Ce44: =008988
there was no way out
he could not transform into wind because he was completely submerged!
so he was faced with two possibilities
either he could figure out how to make himself disappear completely, using the ability he hoped to master
or he could drown in the oil
_
221. Ce45: =008989
drowning obviously would have been bad :p
but disappearing wouldnt be much better!
he would appear somewhere else, having made no progress on his personal quest
his planet would still be polluted and he would be no closer to playing his song
somehow he understood the only way was to conceive of a third option
an idea beyond the simple binary set of outcomes before him
and interestingly
it was coming to this understanding which gave him the first glimpse of how to control the power
he realized it wasnt himself that he needed to make disappear...
_
222. Ce46: =008990
it was the oil!
_
223. Ce47: =008991
he dispersed every drop throughout existence
_
224. Ce48: =008992
leaving a little mark for anyone who might notice, signifying his final mastery over his confining reality
_
225. Ce49: =008993
but more importantly...
_
226. Ce50: =008994
leaving his planet clean
_
227. Ce51: =008995
and the pipes clear
_
228. Ce52: =008996
finally they were ready to let the breeze flow
_
229. Ce53: =008997
so he could play his song
_
230. Ce54; JC3: =009103
hi jane!
heheh. i said the same thing when i got here too
nope :B
callie helped me make mine
arent we adorable?
_
231. Ce55; JC4: =009165
guys i think weve heard enough about the trickster stuff :|
_
232. Ce56; JC5: =009166
jane, dont you remember when we turned into bad guys?
yeah...
i turned into an evil werewolf for a while
and you i think were some kind of cyborg
ummmmm
you had a pitchfork thingy and your outfit was bright red
yeah, we both were
it feels like it was all a bad dream
im glad its over now, even if it means were probably dead
:o
what did you say?
...
_
234. Ce57; JC6: =009167
i second the motion
_
235. JC7: =009170
i did? :o
_
236. JC8; Ce58: =009171
well forget about the story for a second
just tell us with regular words... i mean if you want to
_
237. JC9; Ce59: =009255
its sad she died, but then, isnt it kinda sad we all died?
personally im really hoping she shows up!
jane why dont you prepare a trollsona for her as a gesture of reconciliation?
its the least you can do :B
_
238. JC10; Ce60: =009256
so getting back to the story
i take it from what you said about letting your guard down...
you believe this was how you died?
yeah...
likewise :\
_
239. JC11: =009257
...
jeez!
_
240. JC12: =009258
youre really good at telling stories jane!
hear hear! 5 stars, would listen again! :)
_
241. JC13; Ce61: /shes8ack/
i remember now
i remember what happened to us!
janes story helped jog my memory of the final moments
shes right
when i went to hijack the meteor, there was someone there i didnt expect to see
i think jane covered the "who" pretty well with her colorful description already
whats more interesting is, it made me realize ive been wrong all along
we were never dead at all
weve been asleep!

242. JC14; Ce62: =009463
good question
i have no idea!
wait...
you can do that??
_
243. Ce63; JC15: =009464
wow!!!
ok then i guess that settles that
but before we go...
i just want to say, in case we never get another chance to...
what the
something is happening
_
244. Ce64; JC16: =009477
i know this place
_
245. Ce65; JC17: =009479
its echidnas lair
or my memory of it at least
_
246. Ce66; JC18: =009480
or possibly...
someone elses?
_
247. JC19: =009481
jane??
_
248. AC1: =009500
hi!
its good to see you again
how long has it been?
_
249. AC2: =009787
sooooo
where exactly are we going?
um
and where is that?
......
_
250. AC3: =009788
well wherever it is...
im kinda wondering if
maybe i should be waking up soon?
i feel like my friends are probably going to need me
why?
where my physical form is?
then...
what about here?
argh
sorry
this time stuff is really confusing
yeah
i mean
if its not the right time to wake up where im sleeping...
how long do i have to wait HERE in order to wake up?
really?
all of them??
i understand how this place has time and space of course.... even if they work together weirdly
but
i dont see any of the others
...
oh
wow
i am not sure i totally understand...
but that is pretty interesting!
yeah i guess so
physics are all about space and time and such which are fun to think about
i like all that stuff!
so youre saying space and time... and all other aspects i guess... are more closely related here than in like
umm...
more stable places, like my universe?
you said passage of time is inseparable from...
traveling through space?
so if we were holding still
time wouldnt be moving either?
i see
so
if the cracks werent there
how...
how would we be able to tell if we were moving?
hmmmm
that is pretty cool too
i love spacey stuff!
you talk about it in a neat way
it kinda seems like you are trying to educate me on this
like a teacher or something :)
oh
heh
_
251. AC4: =009789
well.......
not that it isnt fun talking about these cool space things
and
i know you said my real body isnt supposed to be waking up yet, wherever and whenever it is
but to tell you the truth...
i would really love to get going and see my friends again!
dont you have the power to wake me up?
the other calliope said she has that power
oh
soooooo
could you please wake me up then?
aw
why not!
maaaan
>:(
