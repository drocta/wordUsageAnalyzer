Act 1
_
1. JE1: =001926
hey so what sort of insane loot did you rake in today 
oh hell that is such a coincidence i just found an unopened container of apple juice in my closet it is like fucking christmas up in here 
but
the seal on the bottle is unbroken
are you suggesting someone put piss in my apple juice at the factory 
why did the fat kid or whoever drank it know what piss tasted like 
i mean his reaction was nigh instantaneous
ok i can accept that
monster B-list celebrity douchebags are cunning and persistent pranksters
also fred savage has a really punchable face
but who cares about this lets stop talking about it
did you get the beta yet 
 man i got two copies already
but i dont care im not going to play it or anything the game sounds boring
did you see how it got slammed in game bro????
yeah
why dont you go check your mail maybe its there now
_
2. JE2: =001935
is it there
plz say yes
maybe you can play with TT shes been pestering me all day about it
shes mackin on me so hard all the time i start to feel embarrassed for her
i mean not that i can blame her or anything
thank you
whats your modus
how do you retrieve artifacts from it
stack?? hahahahahaha
hash map
my bro taught me a few tricks he basically knows everything and is awesome 
you should probably brush up on your data structures
did you at least allocate your strife specibus
 it could free up a card for you
plus let you attack stuff whenever things get too hot to handle
which is never
what have you got
wow you really suck at this dont you
just get rid of the arms and then allocate the hammer to the specibus
i dont know just use the arms on any old thing and see if it works
_
3. JE3: =001939
hammerkind?
ok that will be the permanent allocation for your specibus
i guess i should have mentioned that
hope you like hammers dude!
_
4. JE4: =002010
hey GG is looking for you why are you even so popular all of a sudden
is today some sort of special occasion or something
did you do something to curry favor with ladies
did you break your leg on a puppy or some shit
dude what are you doing
no stop
just no
dont talk about your awful stupid movies or make references to them
your gross man-bro crush on matt macconahay is an unsavory thing to behold
sounds like a noise a horse would make
ie dumb
equally dumb are all those pictures of that clown youve got hanging up 
i was talking about nick cage
ha ha so lame
you dont even like him ironically or anything this is like for real isnt it
hahaha
no those are awesome
im wearing them ironically
because theyre awesome
the fact that theyre ironic makes them awesome
and vice versa
are you taking notes on how to be cool?? jesus get a fucking pen
ew yeah
oh well
anyway speaking of which
did you get the mail
did there happen to be a package there
you should probably open it
oh man the beta came
haha no way
it sounds so HELLS of boring just get TT to play it she is all about that 
her internet is blinking in and out i guess
probably be back online soon
oh and christ in a sidecar are you still using the stack modus???
seriously dude
you need to BONE UP on your data structures that shit is just ridiculous
_
5. JE5: =002104
i heard you got the box
i hope you appreciate my heroic fatherly perseverance in getting it to you
in my rough and tumble dirty wifebeaterly sort of way
also i hope you appreciate how many no-talent douches had their mitts on that bunny before you
its like a grubby baton in some huge douchebag marathon
hey where are you
dude i told you to steer clear of that game
and for that matter you should probably wash your hands of flighty broads and their snarky horseshit altogether
oh man
how big is it
like the size of texas
or just rhode island
theyre always throwing around these geographical comparisons to give us a sense of scale like it really means anything to us
but its like it doesnt matter its always just like: WOW THATS PRETTY FUCKING BIG
like mr president theres a meteor coming sir. oh yeah, how big is it? its the size of texas sir
OH SHIT
or, how big is it? its the size of new york city sir
OH SHIT
sir im afraid the comet is the size of your moms dick
OH SNAP
sir are you familiar with jupiter
you mean like the planet?
yeah
well its that big sir
hmm that sounds pretty big
i have a question
is it jupiter?
yes sir, earth is literally under seige by planet fucking jupiter
OH SHIT
anyway later

ben or bruce? dudes reach a truce
put their blowchutes to use and up-suck it
afflecks saclifice, i mean -crifice, would have to sufflice. aw fluck it
bro be a stained-glass saint, up on a cross gettin hella christ-plagiarous
bruce's like offa that cruciflix, nuff a this fuckin savior-fuss
restrained his ass per mclane-redux while buscemi remained derangerous
when a plan gone astray pays off a wasted craterous
ash tray caterin to layers of matt maconnaheys vague remainder-dust
wait
uh
macconahey wasnt even in any of those meteor movies was he
ill have to make a rap about
i dont know
morgan freeman or something
being the president
itll be called
"obama made it so that no one gives a shit about black presidents in movies anymore"
see youve got to fill me in on whats going on
so i have something to rap about besides all your dumbshit movies
_
7. JE7: =002194
when the film crew zooms where the presidents at
im like if that dudes black ill eat my hat
turns out he is, so we're all "damn, director's got gumption"
like we'll all flip our shit he aint shining shoes or somethin
its called freemancipation. if its not pres-election its god-ascension
in bruce almighty. whoops, different bruce from the one i just mentioned
cant explain to me why this aint condescension to think ill shit a brick
not even he can convey the intention with his quickspun wit
rather defray all this tension, sit on his lap while he whittles a splint
and some guy eyes what he does and patronizes: i guess negrocity's the mother of invention
whats up
ok
my copy?
thats going to be tough
i lost it
its a stupid story and id rather not talk about it
shit be embarrassing yo
well yeah

an orphan or something i dont know
face flush on the pavement
im like dude you listening for a stampede of buffalo or something?
he braves a look at me then gives my shoe a little kiss and scurries the fuck off
yeah
not kicking oliver twist in the fucking face every day is my gift to the world i guess
among other things
i just give and fucking give
oh for fucks sake
youre just lobbying for me to play that dumb game
look i am telling you
egbert is ALL ABOUT that game
he will play it with you and probably be tickled retarded about it
yeah yeah
ill hassle him some more about it
and look how about this
if you ever find yourself in the position where your life depends on me playing that piece of shit game, then ill play
will that make you happy
_
10. JH1: =002282

oh yeah
i was being sort of cagey and told him to check the mail cause i was wondering if mine came yet

so uh
i guess you want to know if he likes it or something?
oh
uh
wow sorry to hear that i guess?

FU
its sharp and its awesome and its a sword
end of story
howie??
dude monsters arent real
thats stupid kids stuff for stupid babies
what are you an idiot
of course there are monsters in your house
youre in some weird evil monster dimension come on
skepticism is the crutch of cinematic troglodytes
like hey mom dad theres a dinosaur or a ghost or whatever in my room. "yeah right junior go back to bed"
fuck you mom and dad how many times are we going to watch this trope unfold it wasnt goddamn funny the first time i saw it
just once id like to see dad crap his pants when a kid says theres a vampire in his closet
"OH SHIT EVERYONE IN THE MINIVAN"
be fuckin dad of the year right there
what do you have a hammer
man so lame
ok whatever
you should look into weaponizing your sylladex
my bro is always getting on my case about it but man its not as easy as it sounds
but if youre fighting monsters left and right you dont have much choice
im out in the living room hes usually here
but i dont see him
might be playing his mind games hes always pulling this ninja shit
all i see is lil cal over there so i guess he cant be far
what
oh lil cal? no man
lil cal is the shit
yeah bullshit
cal is dope
puppets are awesome
john egbert blows
the end
_
12. RL2: =002319
oh there you are
john said your house was burning down are you on fire yet or what
oh well thats a relief
john told me to get the game to help get you out of there so im working on that now
yeah my bros copy long story
hey
dont tell john this but i think he might have been right about the puppets
theyre sort of starting to freak me out a little
i mean dont get me wrong i think its cool and all
the semi-ironic puppet thing or whatever
or semi-semi ironic
man i dont even know
im just starting to think some of this shit is going a little far and its kind of fucked up
haha yeah well YOU WOULD
oh man i wish lil cal wouldnt look at me like that
with those dead eyes jesus
sometimes i dream that hes real and hes talking to me and i wake up in a cold sweat and basically flip the fuck out
oh god why did i just tell you my dream

ok wait hold on why am i getting this stupid game for you
youre the one who should be wrist deep in puppet ass
the problem is i am up to my goddamn neck in fucking puppet dong
i am enrobed in chafing, wriggling god fucking damned puppet pelvis
an obscenely long, coarse kermit cock is being dragged across my anguished face
you dont seem to harbor any sympathy for the fact that ive burrowed fuck deep into lively, fluffy muppet buttock
im whirling in the terrible cyclone at the epicenter of my own personal holocaust of twitching foam noses
its like a fucking apocalypse of perky proboscis here
like
the proboscalypse i guess
what no
no listen
no oh jesus
ok dickinson if you can shut your perfumey trap for a half second
this is serious
i am just saying
if i see one more soft bulbous bottom being like

even worse im wasting a killer fursona here
like
i dont know like a wide open v shaped leotard and a fuck ton of body paint
some like sinewy back arching cirque du soleil looking motherfucker
always low to the ground gettin a good prowl on
like i dropped my keys in the dark
nimblest son of a bitch who had the gumption to glue a nasty pair of latex cat lips to his face
for a reason that wasnt a joke

_
23. TN1: =002999
oh my god you type like a tool
this is so weak im almost getting tired of wasting good material on you guys
its like
youve got nothing
its always one of you sprouting up and ranting about how hard im about to get trolled
with no ensuing substance
you dont even know anything about us
one of you fuckers thought i was a girl
sorry i wouldnt cyber with you dude
in the future or whatever
human innuendo
so at what point in the future am i supposed to look forward to you whipping up this titanic hankerin for my knob
be honest with me
cause im busy
and i want to know exactly when i got to clear some space in my calendar for when some fuckwit blunders out of a magical phone booth and makes a ballad-inspiring play for my throbbing beef truncheon
no man
look
i just need to know when to be there
when the stars come into alignment and your flux capacitor lets you finally sate your meteoric greed for crotch-dachshund
i wouldnt want to miss it and cause a paradox or something
itd suck if the universe blew up on account of you missing your window of opportunity to help yourself to a pubescent boy's naked spam porpoise
jesus you are such a shitty troll
oh no
no dude
you sassed me up
we are in THE SHIT now
together
for the long haul
we're motherfuckin entrenched in this bitch
you and me
welcome to nam
now grab my hand and shimmy your soggy ass off that muddy bank before charlie gets the fuckin drop
hes the guy whos gonna read our vows
im feeling pretty friggin MATRIMONIAL all a sudden
take a look down by your foot see that little bottle
stomp on that shit like its on fire
noisy ethnic dudes are flipping the fuck out and waving us around on chairs til someone gets hurt
im your 300 pound matronly freight-train
and my gaping furnace is hungry for coal so get goddamn shoveling
bro look in my eyes
that twinkle
that be DEVOTION you herniated pro wrestlers sweaty purple taint
sparklin like a visit from your fairy fuckin godmother
shit be PURE AND TRUE
thats what you see
a kaleidoscopic supernova of all your hopes and dreams all swishin together
radially effevescing arms of more little boy peckers than you can imagine
turning out insane corkscrew haymakers of a billion dancing vienna sausages strong
this is how we do this
this shits more real than kraft mayo
_
24. RL7: =003048
alright im installing this game finally
yeah
you could almost say
where making this
TRANSPIRE

_
25. RL8: AND JH4: =003293
RL - hey
will you open your laptop already
see
this is why you need a phone or something
that alerts you to important messages
instead of leaving them trapped
under three inches of fucking yarn
laptops dont need cozies
nothing needs cozies
cozy is a goddamn adjective
maybe ill crochet myself an iphone snuggly
what is this place anyway
what are you doing
i can see your whole damn house here if you want to get filled in or something im sort of the guy with the big picture here
dont make me bop you on the head with a wizard
ill do it
ok no i wont
yet
i guess ill bone up on the faq for a while
so i dont do anything stupid and deploy like 10 crux flangers and fuck up the whole game
oh my god
so many words
do you think like the pulitzer committee is secretly scouring the dregs of the gamefaq archives or something
damn
i cant read this shit im sorry
JH - whoa ok hey
yeah
but she wont answer me
pretty much you have no idea how much i fuckin own at this game
i bested no less than three flaming tornados and broke a huge wizard
it feels like
i am in sports
all alone
and i am the star
its me
and then the big man comes
no you got it
we're good
reference secured
wait what
oh man
this is ridiculous
i just set this shit up with rose and now i got to do like
some double duty thing
i mean i own at the game and all but cant i just relax for half a second
what
look i was getting my ass handed to me by my bro on the roof for like an hour and a half
i got served like a dude on butler island
wait does this mean theres a big meteor coming soon
when you activate the thing will it start the countdown and summon the meteor
are you totally sure about all this
ok yes that image is definitely conclusive proof of something and is 100% understandable by anyone who looks at it
how big is this thing
like the size of rhode island or texas or what
i need some context to know how much crap i should be shitting into my pants
well as if like one the size of a bus wouldnt kill me anyway
wait hold on rose is finally opening her stupid laptop
so do your thing i guess
have fun
_
26. RL9: =003299
do you think like the pulitzer committee is secretly scouring the dregs of the gamefaq archives or something
damn
i cant read this shit im sorry
hold what
i see you at your computer typing
what are you doing
dang
hold on
no seriously stop talking to me for a second it looks like jade is dropping the doomsday tube thingy in my room
brb gotta make sure she doesnt break all my shit
_
27. JH5: =003300
hey wait
i always keep birds in here its sort of my thing
no no thats irony this is like
sincere honest to god psychosis
im training to be a lame gothy supervillain
ok
well maybe you should take the opportunity to put it somewhere that isnt stone cold retarded
no its not
_
28. RL10: =003301
i dont know how does she do any of the loopy batshit nonsense she does
maybe she pulled them out of the volcano over there on bloodmonkey mountain
we went over this
i was a little bogged down
in the epic swaddle of legendary puppet taint
whoa wait
what the hell is she doing
shes taking my bed what the hell
_
29. RL11: =003302
so seriously what were you doing just now
who
yeah
oh i see you opted to chat up one of those dbags instead of talk to the guy who saved you from a swirling shitstorm of angry flaming wizards
i was worried your priorities might have been out of whack but no i was dead wrong
how is he
i should probably text him soon
see whats up
because
i love him
so this place youre at now
its the same place hes at right
_
30. JH6: =003338
this is the worst shitting thing ive ever seen
the thing that just happened
jesus
and the worst thing is
all that juice i drank
i mean
you just HAD TO FIGURE all that juice was going to come back to haunt me
like frankensteins incontinent fucking ghost
it was like
chekhovs juice
let me be perfectly clear
what i am trying to say is
its like fucking christmas up in my bladder here
and where do i find my toilet
oh look here it is
amputated in my room
gagged with a towel like a fucking prison hostage
and now the cruxploder is counting down
4 hours oh i guess thats not that bad
what
oh god
are you asleep
_
31. JH7: =003339
ok
ok lets just
not panic here
lets try to play it cool
and not break all my shit
also dont put anything weird in the seizure kernel
im going to go find somewhere to pee
dont watch me ok
like i know you dream about me enough already
lets keep some shit left to the imagination ok
the last thing i need is for your weird brain webcam to be snapping shots of my dong
your grandpa was a sick fuck why would he build a voyeurbot for a little girl
fuck
_
32. JH8: =003344
what
what is it
what bird
i wouldnt know anything about that
that could be anyones sword
what does it look like
is it a cheap piece of shit
cause i only bother with high quality blades
forged by stoic asian masters
hells of rude kinds of expensive
wait
what do you mean
dammit hold on a minute
_
33. JH9: =003347
wow awesome
so now i guess instead having of a wise or helpful spirit guide sprite thing
im stuck with this brainless feathery asshole
we need to wake you up
youre not very logical like this
kind of dumb really
yeah but come on you sleep like 20 hours a day
_
34. JH10: =003348
where are you sitting
are you on your bed
what side
ok heres what i want you to do
just humor me
raise your left hand
now
just kind of swat the air to your left
_
35. JH11: =003405
oh man
awesome
its awesome where you put that
i was worried we were on the verge of getting some shit done
well where are they
you say there will be stairs
and yet
i see no stairs
sorry
am i supposed to break that thing
or hatch it
or what
also what happened to all my shit
the stuff scattered all over the roof
did you put it somewhere
i mean not that i care
it was a lot of mostly useless garbage
i was going to use it to fight my bro with
but i guess i forgot in the heat of battle
also he was too fast
_
36. JH12: =003407
ok so
the egg is now in a nest made of shitty swords and soft puppet ass
please advise
do you think thatll take more than four hours
its hot as the sizzle side of a steak
maybe i should try to get it back
and put it in the microwave
_
37. JH13: =003410
you mean the jumper block thing
wait what
the thing costs 1000 for me
what
man i only got 200 to splash around with in roses rainbow world
what the hell
hang on ill ask
she says 20
yeah
so i guess you can buy everything now
ok now i know youre making this shit up
well all i got here is the designix which i cant deploy cause i dont have any purples
and the expensive as hell jumper thing and the cheap shunts which i assume do dick all without the jumpers to put em on
oh also this cd which is 100 but i didnt drop cause it seemed like a stiff allocation of resources for now
so with each new connection in our player chain i guess new weird deployables are introduced
hey look we're learning stuff
_
38. JH14: =003411
what should i do with these beta copies
i dont really need them anymore
wow that was a weird answer
but ok
_
39. JH15: =003463
ok
_
40. JH16: =003464
so i guess this is just a built in designix
which is sort of cool i guess
since i wont have to go downstairs and bang the hallway door into the thing and squeeze through every time i want to punch a card
because of course you couldnt have just put it next to the alchemiter in the first place
but then i have to go downstairs anyway to make totems and get cruxite and stuff
so really who cares
_
41. RL12: =003488
im building up your house
by the way why do you live in this weird compound
do you host east european industrial raves
nevermind the point is
im out of grist
so if youre done whipping that ogre like a rented mule
maybe you could convert it into a grist windfall
i dont know beach the thing first i guess
unless you were planning on sailing that ogre down the mississippi with a runaway slave
what do you mean
you kill it
release a shitload of grist
maybe take one of your needles and puncture the base of its skull
does it even have a skull
or a brain stem
can you find out
what
but you just rigged the thing with an oedipal harness and rode its torso like a log flume ride down a magical rainbow
this is bullshit its an unfeeling monster who gives a fuck
wow fuck ok
you can either kill it for the loot or wait a couple hours for gristtorrent to steal more of johns
but then again ill be pretty busy in a couple hours so make up your mind
no but hes still got a ton so screw him
yeah me too
_
42. KM1: =003489
who
oh yeah sure
i command her alright i am like the pimpmaster hustledaddy of all snippy bookshrews
wrong what do you want
what the hell
you have no idea dude she is so in my grill
like a stray hotdog that rolled down there
and now its too much trouble to fish out with the tongs
so you just watch it like crack and turn black
man wait
whats this about
you have a thing for her dont you
dont deny it bro its obvious
hahahaha so terrible
what a transparent dodge
all hiding behind your alien shit
just admit it
ok well its easy
for everything she says take her to mean just the opposite
see not everybody always means literally what they say the way john and jade always do
oh my flipping christ
ok if you want rose to dig you you got to leave that crap in the shitty scifi novels where it belongs
oh ok
that was pretty good
maybe even too deadpan but its a start keep at it
hahaha yes youre on a roll
oh
alright look
if you want to keep her attention you got to pull out all the stops
reverse psychology mind games all sorts of machiavellian bullshit
i mean unless youre really smooth and inherently likeable like me which youre not
thats kind of the obtuse alien way of getting it but yeah
be like
an antagonism ninja
like her
i dont know you sort of remind me of her anyway so maybe thats a good thing
it could be a horrible thing though
yeah i guess i am
i guess im saying be a less shitty troll
good luck bro
_
43. TN2: =003495
dont care
_
44. JE14: =003537
ok im in
the medium
what do you mean already shit took 4 goddamn hours
i dont want to talk about it
imagine the worst day of my life
just stood up and clinked a glass like it was about to give a speech
then took a shit in my dinner and passed out with its pants down
yeah
stfu
what are you doing
ok
i need some advice
my kernelsprite which was this brainless feathery asshole with a sword in it
turned into this bigger like ghostly feathery asshole
with a sword in it
it seems to want me to prototype it again
not sure what to do
shes asleep for some reason
yeah i saw her there
all tuckered out
like she got smacked in the face with a pillow case full of the snooze wizards beard dander
cause obviously its fuckin prime time for swiping some shuteye about now
like a few hours into her magic stupid quest
anyway what do you think
ok fine but
it seems to be suggesting something here
and
i guess im kinda weirded out by its suggestion
ok well it definitely sounds like youre fucking something up over there
but alright later

thats it i cant take it anymore
it was such a huge mistake prototyping seppucrow with this useless mindnumbing jackass
im going back
what do you mean already shit took 4 goddamn months
or something
i dont know im kind of losing track of how long its been with all this time hopping
what else is there to know
we lost
cant finish the game with a dead heir and witch
yeah well she had a big fucking meteor bearing down on her and we never heard from her again
or the trolls for that matter
after they tricked john into skipping way ahead and getting his ass handed to him by the denizen
i guess once they managed to sabotage us they were done with us
and since john died he couldnt get jade in on time so whether shes alive or not shes as good as dead from our perspective
only thing left to do is change all that
theres not much to remember
i go back and tell john not to be an idiot and get trolled like such a gullible stooge
i dont know what he was thinking
even we couldnt kill one of those things yet
with our higher levels and all our sick gear
nah itll be fine dont worry
i dont know
i mean your whole timeline will
maybe
the thing with time travel is
you cant overthink it
just roll with it and see what happens
and above all try not to do anything retarded
try going to sleep
our dream selves kind of operate outside the normal time continuum i think
so if part of you from this timelines going to persist thats probably the way to make it happen
and hey you might even be able to help your past dream self wake up sooner without all that fuss you went through
the true purpose is to make a sprite that doesnt make me want to flog myself raw with my own brain stem
anything else is gravy
yeah thatd be cool i guess
im gonna go now

48. JE16: =003547
WAIT
dont go yet
somethings up
_
49. JE17: =003548
ok its me from the future
its me
i just appeared
from the future
wearing a rad suit
he says dont go
or youre gonna die
_
50. JE18: =003549
he says i dunno gullible enough to trust a leetspeaking troll who wants you dead and strap on a rocket pack cause she said to
ok that was probably the dumbest thing you ever said just now
do you hear what youre saying oh my god
this guy is me if i get him to talk to you youre just talking to me again jesus it proves nothing
john stop being a tool and unbuckle yourself from that piece of shit
if our friendship means anything youll listen to me and past dave
this is future dave by the way
yeah exactly why would i bother
this sort of cornball horseshit is your cup of tea not mine
dont make me track you down through time and stop you in person
oh god did you just blast off
ok well just dont ok
im turning this timeline over to past dave
and helping you all stay alive and do this thing the right way this time
just stay on the goddamn ground for fucks sake
_
51. DaSp1: =003551
hey
_
52. DaSp2: =003558
who were you talking to
ok cool
so now that youre a sprite
do you know everything about the game
alright
here goes
why are we so fucking awesome
yeah
so is everything cool with this john business
is he gonna be ok
ok
like what
i was in the middle of the nancho party arc
yeah that was sorta the plan
making a ten part story about nachos was always a bullshit idea
yeah sure
_
53. JE19*: =003562
so hey
since its your bday i had to get you back for the sick memorabilia you got me so i got you this godawful thing and now i just know youre standing there flipping your shit over it so youre welcome.
its the actual gross bunny in the movie so that means nick cage actually grubbed it up with his clownish no talent fingers. i would suggest you put it somewhere and display it ironically but i know youre dead serious about this ridiculous shit so youll probably sleep with the damn thing and nibble its ear and stuff.
but the weird thing is thats whats cool about you. youre this naive guy like pinocchio tumbled ass backwards off the turnip truck and started liking ghostbusters. then the fairy godmother kissed your nose or some shit and you turned out to be not made of wood and also pretty cool to talk to. one day your gooberish ways are gonna land you in a jam and i know im going to have to get you off the hook but its cool i got your back bro.
then we'll meet and hug bump and get each others filthy wife beaters that much filthier so yeah
peace dawg
tg
_
54. JE20: =003566
did you blast off like a spazzy douche yet or what
god dammit what do i have to do to make you believe me
fist bump my future self til i got bloody knuckles and write you an even sappier bday note in my own blood
on a back to the future poster
oh ok
so you believe me then
about future me
and like
him turning into a floating sword bird
oh man and if weve just concluded anything its that talking to those dbags should be priority number one so yeah go right ahead
_
55. JE21: =003592
yo
what did you do
ahahahahaha
pff
dont worry about it
cause i wouldnt give a shit
and hes me
what
really
ok
dont go anywhere
im coming down to the computer
_
56. JE22: =003593
ok i dont know what youre doing here
but i think we can both agree that youve got to rummage through as much of her shit as possible before she wakes up
dude no come on
shes out like a light anyway
it was some like weird future thing that happened that made her sleep
yeah
shit doesnt get more clear than that
fine dont
but here just do this one thing
see those two notebooks on the floor behind you
you dont have to read them im not telling you to
what kind of prying tool do you take me for
just pick them up
you know like tidy up a bit since you made a royal fucking dump of her room just now
_
57. JE23: =003594
now i need you to do something else
this is important
like for important game reasons and stuff
take the card the books are on
flip it over
so you can see the code
dude you dont have to tell me the code
just flip it over and let me know if theres a code there thats all
alright cool
you can ditch the books now if you want
maybe put them back on the floor
so rose doesnt think you were snooping
seriously youve got some grubby fingers bro why dont you mind your own business there
what is even with you
isnt that your birthday package there
maybe you should look at it
i dont think it counts as snooping since its technically yours
_
58. JE24: =003605
afdsjjjjjjjjvfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
_
59. RL14: =003757
whoa why are you burning your wizard fanfiction
oh ok
then why are you burning that
is that some dumb wizard thing you just made up
or something to do with tentacle monsters
i cant keep track of what you like anymore
john told me
he was all snoopin around your room while you were asleep and i was like no man dont
so not cool
then he was like haha dude check it out this book is full of wizard slash
and i was like i dont even want to know this is such a crazy violation of privacy
do you want me to chew him out about it i will because that was so outrageous i dont know where he got off being like that
i thought you hated wizards
whats the deal with that
oh man thats so messed up
that you think that
she probably digs wizards for real just like you and youre blowing shit out of proportion like pretty much always
you and she could probably have been chatting up how awesome wizards were this whole time but no
youre probably burning your nutjob meow book to spite her too arent you
oh yeah
i thought that was a joke
when did they say that
you mean when we were dancing and stuff in our dreams
ive never seen or heard these things in my dreams
uh yeah
no what a ridiculous question
....
........
..........................
dunno
anyway yeah i guess ill do that
get some sky monsters to boss me around sounds cool
_
60. RL15: =003758
are you talking to future me
ok im out of the loop again
between you taking orders from dream beasts and bird wing me with like
future secrets
im doing some sort of spectacular fucking jackknife off the loop and getting a wink and a nod from barack obana
im coming upstairs
_
61. DaSp3: =003761
so it was pretty funny how i made a copy of roses evil book right before she burned it and now she doesnt know about it
the best thing about how i did that is how it in no way will ever come back to bite us in the ass ever
so safe
safer than some flintstone vitamins in a bottle
keep twisting junior all you get is clicks
yeah
anyway guess ill go back down and burn that book
_
62. TP1: =003835
what
fuck off
youre the annoying blind one arent you
dave told me about you
man im telling you burns like that are unreal
where do you even get a burn thats that sick
no you messed that up
uh
did you try to draw shades on his face and miss
whats even the point hes already wearing shades
this is moronic
i dont know what it smells like or tastes like
but i sure as hell know what it looks like
like a fuckin symphony on my retinas
shit is beautiful like a little vermilion picnic on my hands
every day i open my eyes i find poetry in even the simplest things
just one of those little joys in life you take for granted you know
this miraculous gift of vision
i could give myself a hernia trying to be as big a douche as that guy
i could try but it would wind up like a motorcycle stunt gone horribly wrong
my broken body would flop and tumble around like a rag doll
and yet as much as that guys the tooliest dude i could ever hope to meet he and i would still get along famously
cause we can both see
just him and me
havin a see party
like a couple of eagle eyed bros peepin shit up into the wee hours 
i guess but youll have to be careful not to stumble around bumping into all the gorgeous masterpieces hanging around everywhere
god so beautiful to look at with my perfect eyesight
yeah thats fine
_
63. TP2: =003839
oh hell
that
ok thats pretty amazing
hey speaking of which
where is my bro anyway
havent seen him at all since i got here
davesprite doesnt know
you can see everything that goes on right
or like smell it or whatever
how does that even work
how do you use a computer and know whats going on it doesnt make sense
my face doesnt make sense
hahaha
ew
oh ok
so the dumbest and most far fetched explanation imaginable ok got it
man dont remind me about that
so embarrassing
ok cool
whos upset
bout time the dude gave me a little space
i guess
alright so whats next
why would i be scared
we have cotton candy dumpass
_
Act 5
_
Act 5 Act 2
_
64. JE25: =004637
hey
has it
man who cares
i mean thats great and all
but i talked to you plenty more times since that from where im standing
ive got to make this quick
fuck no fuck that trollian horseshit
its just regular old time travel
im from the future
no
just regular ordinary dave from the fucking future nothing special dude come on
yeah ok it is awesome but im in a hurry
i need to borrow some boondollars off you
no they do do something
what do you think they buy shit its fucking money
i cant answer all these questions dude youll find out anyway its not like youll even really need your money
you you might as well give it to me
all of it
ill pay you back
in the future
if theres one thing im not short on its the fuckin future
yeah we do
but chronologically ive been around for at least triple that
no shit your deal is wind not time
youre on easy street what is there even to think about with wind
like what angle to blow it at to fly a damn kite or how gentle its gotta be to make a picnic go swimmingly
its kiddie bullshit time is serious fucking business
leave it to the pros ok
yeah it can work that way
or not
ive been very careful
this whole operation is strung together with stable time loops
no timeline offshoots cause thats when daves start dying and that isnt no good for nobody
yeah
there are a bunch of daves running around the timeline
but they are all me
i mean they will all become me and ill become them one way or another
thats how stable time loops work shit takes a lot of planning and precise choreography
ive got some help though
yeah
man dont even get me started with that
the 24 hour span of the reckoning is like some kind of critical spike in us dealing with troll bullshit
i guess its just when the most shit is going down so they figure thats the best time to mess with us
i dont know man they seem to flock to me
ive been laying waste to chumps nonstop
its like they heard somebody over here was handing out asses and theyve known nothing but years of bitter ass famine
oh you know
noirs outta control
rose is crazy jades crazier and youre
well youre you
and together were up to our bulges and miscellaneous bullshit alien physiology in hot sloppy shenanigans while hatching plans under our feathery asses like a bunch of cage free farm fresh motherfuckers
but im not about to get into specifics cause this is complicated enough as it is
and if i started ranting too much about the future id start sounding like one of these smug alternian shitheads and im not about to drop that retarded science on my good bro
so im staying on track here
speaking of which
give me your money
oh christ
only one
well fuck nevermind then
i thought youd have more by now but thats goddamn peanuts
i mean
ill take it anyway but damn
im working the system here
using time loops to manipulate the incipispheres financial sector
making a goddamn killing in the lohacse
lohac stock exchange
my planet
land of heat and clockwork dude come on
you know like gears and lava and shit
wrong it kicks ass
egbert stfu and give me your goddamn boonbuck j3gus fuck
ill turn it into a boonmint in an hour and youll get it back ok
no comment
you can wire it to my account
ill send you the app
i know
but this takes like two seconds
dude
dont do the vriska thing ok
shes messed up we talked about this
or will talk
whatever
alright app incoming
gotta go later
_
65. TP3: =004642
hey
have i made enough money yet
ok
fuck
bout time
what took so long
k cool lets see it
damn
thats incredible
oh shit really
that loud sound of shock you just smelled was my jaw hitting the floor
yeah i mean
i cant possibly argue with any of that
so are we done making money yet or what
yeah i kinda figured
im not complaining
but you said there was something specific we were working toward here
i mean aside from buying up all the nastiest fraymotifs
competitive
man
dont matter what i do im not gonna outpace egbert
hey its not like the futures a mystery or anything weve both seen it
well
ive seen it
youve just caught a whiff of it
like a hungry beggar loitering cross the street of an olive garden
just cause a filthy vagrants barred from entry dont mean a dude doesnt know italian foods nearby its a fucking fact to his nose
yeah fine
so whats the other thing we were accomplishing here
does that get to be not an obnoxious secret yet
ok so this was your game
to get rich off me
alright well its not like i even have a problem parting with this useless bullshit money
how much do you need
thats all
i can afford to give you a fuckload more than that
how bout i give you an even boonbank
ok just to be clear
thats 413
not "aie"
whats up with that number
ive seen it around
whats that mean
ok awesome
you mean i can do that
then
why werent we just wiring money into the past for these investment escapades instead of doing all this time traveling
oh yeah
i knew that its just frustrating sometimes its like paradox space makes you do everything the hard way
sure
yeah
reminds me
i made you a comic a while ago
yeah here
yeaho k whatever you say
fuckin aliens
ok cool
hey boonbonds incoming now
brace yourself six hours ago

north american hollering phallus baboon

stand agog and marvel bitch
shaggy 2 dope
ok sorry
its ben stiller
nope
sorry to disappoint you dude
dont care
oh man another failed trolling attempt
i had such high hopes trapezi it started out brilliantly
excuse me but it says right in the header of this conversation that youre trolling me
persterchum always knows
no shit
ok
let me just set aside some time to be stupid enough to believe that
hey looks like next month is chemical lobotomy month youre in luck
so what do you think
time to block you yet or what
drawing a comic
awesome
nah
i dunno
you seem kinda young to me and this thing is like
borderline pornographic
how old are you
goddamn
ok now youre messing with me arent you you arent 6
whatever thats bullshit
ok fuck it
just dont tell your parents
thats just about the saddest thing i ever heard get said
here
http://tinyurl.com/CDandSL
i guess
its ok
im not thrilled with this direction though i think its too much like my bros stuff
need to figure out my own ironic statement to make
spread my wings you know
pretty deep troll girl
ok
i see
that fucking puppet
uh what
man i dunno
wheres this drawing you promised me
oh my fucking hell
that is horrendous
in the most beautiful way
god damn
that mouth
its like
i dont know
a fucking pork chop
jegus
i mean jesus
so overwhelmed i cant even damn type
is there even any other way to draw on a computer
fuckin doubt it
ok lets say its
dave why not
fuck
what the hell could you possibly have to do
doesnt seem like youre into trolling us as much as your numbnut friends
yeah what didnt you get the memo
your leader
thats a retarded thing to say even by the standard of your own bullshit made up vernacular
whos he really
your boyfriend or something
ok asking for an explanation on that is pretty much the exact opposite of what im doing
and interesteds the opposite of what im being
ok that remark was almost as boring as it was weird
haha
i dont cry
oh god
i plan on forgetting about you instantly after this conversation
well maybe
even if thats the case
ill just forget on principle
yeah
pretty cool guy here
case you hadnt noticed
_
67. TP5: =004674
what the fuck was the point of this again
this is bullshit
this was a setup all along
ok jegus
dont say it
if you say i warned you about tears or something one more time
i swear to gog
ok fine
our memes can cancel each other out this time
god dammit
im not actually crying
its the fucking onions
these piece of shit crocodiles are lambasting me with them
i guess the stench of onions is covering up the smell of the truth how convenient
also your nose sux youre not even any good at smellin at all
the only thing im getting
is out of this goddamn idiot cauldron here
the only thing im going to make
is like banana and split
out of this bubbling pail of misery
why whats the relevance of that
tell me its more alien nonsense it will be so awesome to hear more of that
man
why did i ever agree to go along with this horseshit
what secrets
they dont have any secrets
look at them theyre morons
the only secret theyve got is how many times a day they accidentally flush their medical alert bracelets down the toilet
ok im gonna change out of this wet suit
and into a dry shut your fucking mouth
_
68. TP6: =004675
there now i wont be satisfying your crazy red fetish either
all you get to smell is black
like licorice or something
you hate licorice right
shit
ok lets say i dont smell like licorice then
i smell like
a coal miners asshole
whatever
anyway
probably bout time i got on with this game
sans these pointless sidequests you want drag me through for kicks
later terezi nice knowing you
unlikely
you told me remember
why would i forget
oh
i guess i forgot i was supposed to forget
uh alright
what the hell
whats your obsession with making this goofy bullshit anyway
is it troll irony
dont get me wrong its awesome
thats cool
sure thats fine
im still gonna go off and do my own thing though
later
dammit what
yeah fine but i doubt that i
oh fuck there i am hiding behind that column
_
69. TP7: =004679
ok so whats the plan
thats cool
but whats the answer that doesnt have anything to do with meaningless bullshit
time

come on

god dammit
whoa
_
70. TP8: =004680
its like
watching a miracle made of nothing but twitching schroder legs
look at us go
i cant stop watching
damn
those moves
i can see im going to have to drop everything
drop it like its simultaneously hot and i just tripped over the rug
dedicate my undivided attention to this shit
damn youre right
truth be told everyone will be tripping when im done
once i upset this biznasty with my swift cuts
dudes will phalanx themselves agape like theyre offerin to store my shit in their mouths for the night
rows of glasseyed human fly catchers beholding categorical fucking domination of the dance floor
but they wont catch none cause the flys all mine
theres not any i dont have
im crafting a new dance move
to shock the shit out of asses in pants
fred astaires ghost will weep in the arms of his own nimble rotting corpse
its called
the smug cracker parlor wiggle
of course
and just when the scene thought it was startin to recover from its ridiculous erection over that
thats when i bust out another fierce move
i call it rageclock me in the douche smirk plz
cut out to the rude jam "askin 4 it!"
id say if i had to take an educated guess it was outright goddamn unmannerly
needs to get worked over by some stuffy prude at finishing school
i dont know about that
i dont know if you can keep up with me kid
no offense
theres just magic in these shoes and the coy gnome i ransacked wants them goddamn back
ahahahahahaha
_
71. TP9: =004681
i feel like i should be offering some visual rebuttal here
you arent giving me any time though dammit
oh yeah
i keep forgetting i can time travel
thats fine i guess
see
i cant compete with this
_
72. DS10: =004682
but seriously what is the real plan here
that has to do with not fucking around
ok could you try to be somehow even less subtle when you hit on me thanks
man
nevermind
no shit
im going to infer that your species reproduces by having sex with a grub in a bucket or something
am i close
ok sorry
back on point
what are we doing
ok
sounds cool
huh what an odd thing to say
it demands no explanation whatsoever
so how do i start making all this money
tell me anyway
dont know
i never even looked at it
k
ok after all this hype you better be prepared to fucking dazzle me
are you gonna bring it?
awesome
peace out t-z
oh shit

75. JE26; KV2: =004690
what
hey
some kinda asshole rumpus looks like
ok later windbag
nah
no
but whatever he thinks im doing im not going to stop
the guys jealous obviously he thinks his girlfriend has a thing for me and you know what hes probably right
but what else is new just another lady from outer space mackin on me whatever chance she gets
pretty sure she is
or he thinks she is or something
made it pretty obvious when he started ranting at me months ago
back when i suspected these trolls were full of shit
but now look how far weve come
theres not any doubt left about that at all
right
sounds like its time to get a clue she is over you dude
john god dammit stop embarrassing us
first of all weve got to be on record here as not giving a shit about that
second obviously theres gonna be 4 quadrants come on
k then bye
sounds like a loudmouth inferiority thing going on here to me
like you dont want to acknowledge that your troll ladies find a couple of human dudes irresistible
smooth
i dunno
do you like her
yeah ok
but i mean
anything more than that
like
if earth wasnt destroyed and she werent in some other universe on a planet full of unspeakable frothing dipshits
and she was on earth visiting your town or something
would you want to ask her to go see one of your dumbass movies
like the new maconnohey jam where he smirks and like all but deliberately draws the audiences ire like a goddamn magnetron
doesnt concern you dude
i dunno man doesnt sound like you really got our interests in mind here
you just sound kinda bitter
did one of the human ladies reject you
how did it go did you stand in a quadrant like you were playing four square
holding a bucket full of flowers or slime or whatever and jade was like no thanks bro
is that how it went down
or maybe it was a guy who rejected you
haha wow bingo
see how i look right now thats a poker face might want to take some notes
oh god stop talking about my lips thats the second time
ok youre clearly gay and youve probably got some issues about it dude
john just a heads up in the future i think youre gonna spurn one of his awkward advances
what
the fuck
are you talking about
thats obviously not gonna happen
dude
no
just
stop
oh my fucking god
please let this conversation not be taking place
ok youre by far the worst artist out of any of us
and thats saying something
thx for the shipping grid bro imma drop everything and go have a baby with jade right now
no peeking k
you should go back to sleep
it was so much cooler when you were asleep and i basically never had to listen to you ever
_
76. GM1: =004718
what
oh god thats right
you were the best troll
i remember now
yeah
i mean
in the most ironic and hilarious ways possible
but that really shouldnt even need to be said
it was months ago for me
you did your bizarrely oblivious juggalo thing
then bitched and moaned at me for ruining your religion or some horseshit
like i guess a weird crisis in faith i dunno
and then
you kinda got over that i guess
and we both proceeded to have one of the best rap-offs in the history of paradox space
remember
could be time shit
you might not have had the conversation yet
do you remember if you watched any videos
from earth
that i might have sent
dude i was telling you
youve got to check this out
trust me itll lift your spirits shit will all make sense to you finally
youll finally figure out who you are and why you worship all this ridiculous clown bullshit
and also why your planet has faygo for some baffling reason
actually no nevermind it doesnt explain that
that still makes no damn sense
but like
the thing youre looking for
your dark clownish salvation or whatever the fuck
your mirthful messiahs
ahahahaha i cant even type that without lmao
anyway theyre here dude

this is like
our religion man
its fucking serious business its like what our whole culture revolves around
yeah well
used to be dictated
til the rapocalypse happened
i still believe though
in my heart so long as it keeps thumping the righteous beat
subwoofing out devotion every which way
that he will come
our savior

and hed gather up the ashes of our civilization and lift it like its heavy
fuck im tearing up my ishades are gonna fry

that brorage lust youre feelin
turn that bitch inside out like a broke ass millionaires pockets

steer clear a the seer and the knight if youre scared of unfair fights
youll drop like the staircase impaired, seein em spareds a fair fuckin rare sight

more chock full than sad trollian villains cloggin my blocklist
so thoughtful to popul-

youre a fuckin creepy dude
what
you mean the guy who spent years beating my ass down with a puppet
yeah i remember
man
im not that strong ok
just cause i broke a cheap ass sword doesnt make me the fucking hulk
what did you go around breaking a bunch of swords too
how the fuck do you even wield a broken bow
did you go around clubbing shit with the two halves
_
80. EZ4: =004728
whats it look like
so am i
bow down before your new king bitch
_
81. TP12: =004733
please dont say this party started please dont say this party started
god everything is about parties with you
ok
lets see some fine art then
ok that
is every bit as shitty as all your other drawings
i like it though you dont gotta improve
art skills are overrated
its kind of weird though what the hell is actually going on here
does this mean something
yeah
but
why
alright but
i mean even if that made sense which it kind of doesnt
karkat was saying how it was all a game and youre just flirtin and stuff
and that we should quit it because he doesnt want you in my grill or me in yours or whatever
well yeah thats what i thought too
and really if we got no other reason keep rolling with it at least theres that one
to piss him off
im not saying i know for sure but it seems to me like
my grill is your goddamn prison
you are practically incarcerated in that fucker
doing hard time on a bed of charcoal and lighterfluid
privy to what i flame broil from below
what im sayin is you got a front row seat to the brown side of my burger
hows it smell btw
yeah i thought so
so is that whats going on
is this some weird game involving flirtation and assassinations or whatever
thats pretty much the most insulting thing possible to say im anything like that raving gulf of shit
issues
what are you talking about
wow ok what does that have to do with me
i dunno i guess maybe when i become future me
fuck who cares
like i even give a shit about being a hero whatever that even means
im not seeing the problem here future me is awesome he can bail me out if he wants
not gonna happen
hey look at this change of subject going down
about this comic
are you saying im about to fall asleep
_
82. TP13: =004734
why
i dont feel tired
could be rose waking me up again
bonkin me with yarn or some shit
can you see in my dreams
too bad
last time i promised rose id take off my shades and look in the sky for some reason
youre gonna miss a hell of a show
so i guess i have to summon davesprite too
whys that
huh
ok
yeah kinda
didnt think this useless horseshit was boss grade loot to be honest
ok see ya
_
83. DaSp3: =004735
sup
_
84. DaSp4: =004736
is that how you pronounce that
what are welsh things doing in this game
fuck yeah it is
is this thing as pointless as i think it is or do i need it for something
yeah thats what i figured
fuck it ill just power through the rest of the game with the SORD.....
yeah
goddamn jpeg hero
right here
dude its long gone
up in skaia now or something
thrashing ill grinds on clouds
yeah you got it
so why wasnt this legendary pos in the sylladex you gave me
did you chuck it after you alchemized it
should i just chuck it too
hes the denizen right
isnt that like a greek god
or roman or whatever
what is greco roman shit doing in here you know what never mind
whats the forge
huh
you mean jades volcano
so do you know this stuff cause youre from the future or cause youre a sprite
so now youre like
a wise feathery asshole
yeah i guess
really
there was no other way to get it out
thats kind of retarded
ok
yeah
that sounds about like something id do if i were you
which i am
so hey
apparently im about to fall asleep
_
85. DaSp5: =004737
yeah probably
anyway monsters will show up soon and try to eat my sleeping corpse
yeah
so thats where you come in
ok
guess ill make myself comfortable here
what do you mean
where will you go
oh yeah
where do you think he is
what happened to him in your timeline
yeah
ok good luck with that
_
86. JH17; KV3: =004752
ahahahahah oh god
dude i cant believe you were just getting on our case about hitting on the troll girls
and then literally the very next memo you are slobbering all over jade
thats just perfect hahahaha
_
87. JH18: =004924
hey
welcome to the medium finally i guess
ok i dont know what youre talking about it was probably just some horrorterror chirping at you during one of your nap bubble mindfucks
its not the point i just wanted to say
i just saw you
yeah
you appeared for a second
shooting at an imp
then you disappeared
no you can kill them
youll get better dont worry
three places
i remember seeing you twice before in different locations
but at the moment im standing in the middle of this snowy goddamn field freezing my shit off
just wanted to see if you were cool
no i was
this is future me
one of the future mes that is
yeah jade thats what the future me means
yeah
its ok
hey its pretty fucking cold
so im gonna go some place warm be back in a while later
ok im back
an hour later
an hour for me
a second for you
i ran around for an hour got my ass some place warm
went back in time
picked up where we left off
yeah
i guess im sorta used to it by now i dont think of hours going by the same way anymore
i mean
they are my hours but not everyone elses theyre kind of like private hours all to myself
while everyone else is sort of in slow motion stuck in the thick of the alpha
well yeah
my thing is time yours is space
pretty different things
you GET things about space i dont
or you will
yup
pretty believable since you lived on guam or wherever the fuck
and also inside an active volcano
well ive never seen it either now that i think about it
no
nah
lavas better
yeah it is lava and skeletal skyscrapers all melting and shit how is that not way cooler than
snow and
like
more snow
snows a big chilly carpet of nobody gives a shit
like old man winter spread around his nasty mayonnaise and turned the landscape into his personal asshole sandwich
when i look around all i see is the miles of unharnessed snowmen im just too damn cool to build
whoa jade with the fucking haymaker
i need to go look for my teeth on the canvas as soon as shit stops spinning and there stops being like ten of you
time
time
time then shades
time
time/shades lets go
oh my fucking god
im not gonna play in the snow
maybe you missed those credentials i flashed which clearly stated me being too cool for that
like federally too cool
my coolness is named after a dead president plus his middle initial to make it sound extra legit
ok
i thought you were going inside
well at least make some damn clothes
something warmer why dont you alchemize some shit
blew up
i completely understand everything about that practically entirely
no dont bother john
_
88. JH19: =004925
hes on like his fuckin
wind mission or whatever
getting all his ridiculous magic cyclone powers on and realizing his huge blowy destiny
as the chump of shoosh
almost
we all start out somewhere
remember how i was scrambling up that tower to get that egg like an idiot
what the hell was i doing
i was like goddamn pooh bear in a tree reaching up his fat fuckin pooh paw for some mother fuckin honey
so even though im awesome now at one point i was plausibly likened to an autistic stuffed animal
and you even knew what to do
you told me how it worked all christopher robinning my ignorant ass about that egg
but i was all like IM A LITTLE BLACK RAIN CLOUD BITCH WATCH ME CLIMB
so maybe youre startin out with more sense than me
in any case egbert lost his computer and game disc
so he cant do anything for you anyways
probably some shit like thats what happened
but youre not completely screwed
we just have to think outside the box here
yeah honestly i figured wed have to do something like this
so i guess here we are doing it
well youre my server player remember
i need you to deploy something first
in my apartment
in a few hours ill go back there and we can continue this
yeah
as in a few seconds
im back at my place now
yeah
now
deploy the intellibeam laserstation
no it costs practically nothing
check out how much ive got
_
89. JH20: =004926
its mostly pretty stupid and useless
but itll come in handy here
it reads captcha codes
yeah
some are too garbled and complicated
the human eye cant decipher them
needs sophisticated scanning technology
and artificial intelligence to figure it out
yeah well
thats why this is so dumb
_
90. JH21: =004927
i guess some captchas are so incomprehensible cause the game thinks it would be too cheap to let you duplicate them
like an anti piracy measure
so the solution to the anti piracy measure is to override the anti spam measure
well yeah thats what captchas are for
and theyre on the back of cards for a really good reason
cause god knows the last thing youd want was some web bot being able to figure out the code for like
a potted plant
that would be fucking mayhem
but in order to effectively cheat here weve got to open pandoras spam box
and release the laserstation into the world with its leering intellibeam
now no captcha is safe youll have bots signing up for email accounts and duplicating potted plants and shit
basically robots are in control now
which is good news and bad news
the bad news is theyre all pornbots and theyve got LOADS of provocative material theyre just dying to share with us
thats also the good news
whats it look like
im duplicating my server disc
_
91. JH22: =004928
nah i told you were not bothering john
hes got shit to do
ill just install it
dont see why not
we have to get creative here
this games already so far off the rails what else is there to do but improvise
well he was
he got you in didnt he
but now hes not
been a change of plans
time to roll with it
_
92. JH23: =004929
yeah more or less
i never really studied how it went down all that closely
i just figured when the time came to sort it out the right thing to do would be obvious
like it is now
managing the loops is a balance of careful planning and just rolling with your in the moment decisions
and trusting they were the ones you were always supposed to make
by now im pretty used to having my intuition woven into the fabric of the alpha timeline
yeah i know
_
93. JH24: =004930
thisll be the disc i use for your connection
while the original will stay bound to roses connection
well technically
i will be your server
and past me will stay as roses server
which is to say present me will
the one in the black suit
he can keep managing her for a while
until she sorta checks out soon and becomes totally useless
then he can start hopping around time like i did
make a ton of money and stuff
eventually become me
and become your server player
yeah see its not hard to get the hang of
in the meantime ill kind of loiter around this timeframe to help you out for a while
dont worry about it just some more future stuff
now i need you to go downstairs
_
94. JH25: =004931
im just going to cut right to the chase and upgrade your alchemiter so you can avoid a lot of bullshit
ill give you some codes and you can punch cards and slip em into jumper blocks
which are really the exact same codes you first gave me when we upgraded my alchemiter
which seems like a hella long time ago
yeah but it kind of literally is for me
few days i guess
whatever
_
95. RL16*: =004936
hey
what just happened
_
96. RL17: =004937
oh yeah
so shes here then
is she ok what was going on there
i guess i should catch up with her
i am
oh ok time travels involved
thats all you needed to say everythings cool and under control then
weird
and kind of boring
i was in your dream room for a while spying on you
being all creepy and dream duplicitous and shit
whats with your book collection
or
dream book collection
all your books are bizarre and terrible
nah
but yeah i understand defending your collection i guess if you were in my dream room and talking shit about my awesome dream portraits of dream stiller and dream snoop or whatever wed have to have a fucking talk
oh
yeah
i did
horrible things
yeah
it was like
peering through the dark portal of an eldritch red lobster
and scoping out its all you can eat seafood buffet
and
when i saw them
their voices became clearer
i couldnt really focus on anything specific
but
in totality
im pretty sure it was
like
a plea for help
_
97. RL18: =004939
no it was disturbing
so i slapped my shades back on
went and perved up some sleeping girls room to take my mind of it
oh god why would i want that
im not about to get molested by calamari with fucking teeth
use your powers and like
stroke a mummys paw or some horseshit and open a dark channel
tell them to keep their lecherous flagella to themselves
whats that mean
who cares if theyre getting killed
theyre hideous and obnoxious
oh ok cool
_
98. RL19: =004940
oh shit youre kidding
no really are you serious i didnt even notice
fuck mind = blown
ok
what am i supposed to do
like
a treasure map
why
plot a course to what
_
99. RL20: =004941
oh right the green sun ok
wait sorry
i mean the  my bad
whats the deal with this thing
i mean aside from giving jades dog his devil powers
and by extension i guess jack
yeah
how big
i need a sense of scale here
is it like the size of our sun
or bigger
or is it only as big as like
planet fucking jupiter
ok thats pretty fucking big
see how important that contextualization was now i know how fucking impressed i should be
i mean hopy shit thats huge
so ok i make a map to this thing
with the help of a million rambunctious gross tentacle mutants
and then i guess we go there for some reason
why do we need a map
cant they just
tell us what direction its in
point a spaceship that way
blast off to adventure
i can kind of get that time is messed up there
with like loops and causality paradoxes and shit like that
being the knight of time here
not really sure why navigating the space would be a problem though
space isnt my thing remember
what is it like
full of wormholes or something
i thought you werent supposed to know shit about either
seeing as youre the seer whatever that means
fair enough
so i take my map and fly to this thing
ok you fly to it
then what
_
100. RL21: =004942
you mean with the quest youre sending him on
is there anything you do thats not sending dudes on quests
so hes got to get the cancer out of skaia right
yeah
so whats The Tumor do
i mean the tumor
jesus can we stop with the fancy colored text bullshit
well ok you can keep doing it then
ok cool what is it
ok i wont say anything
just tell me
_
101. RL22: =004943
what the hell is a bomb doing in there
first time for everything i guess
seriously whered you get all this info
did you get it all from the gods
are these just a bunch of orders youre following
what
what you mean a troll
sounds like a really credible dude sign me up for trusting everything he says
oh so he knows everything
even if he is omniscient which he probably isnt what if hes just lying
whys he want to die
wait
what
ok i get it now
_
102. RL23: =004944
whoa fuck
a suicide mission are you serious
no bullshit thats not happening
hey look suddenly everything we just talked about was useless because its time to make a plan that doesnt fucking suck
oh
haha yeah thats fine i guess
those fuckers are all kinds of mad expendable
way to leave me hanging there
for someone whos saying lets cool it on the drama the whole i wont be coming back thing is a pretty theatrical bombshell
for future reference
yeah i know
so when do i do my thing
make this map
which i guess is just like
a solid black piece of paper
this is going to be fucking stupid isnt it
alright
so
dog it as long as possible
then travel back to about now and go to sleep
what
no
oh yeah terezi
no shes cool
its blossoming into an interspecies partnership in incredibly shitty cartooning
what do you mean get her to trick someone into putting me asleep again
when did that happen
who did that
god
fuckin trolls
too many of them who can even keep track of this shit
which ones yours
is it the absurd juggalo one that would be hilarious
yeah see what i mean
oh ok
well im suddenly not interested so go talk to your fairy god troll
ill be over here paving the way for your elaborate dream suicide
when i feel like getting around to it i mean
later
_
103. TP14: =004991
ok
what do you mean what
but
you know if im going to or not
its lame for you to pretend theres any element of suspense here
why dont you just tell me
look i dont mind making the decision if thats whats going on here
like doing the free will thing
yes how would it ever stop being a thing
being a things not something it ever stopped doing
i just want to know whats really going on here
before i decide to start choppin off the heads of outrageously good looking snoozing dudes
ok i know but
something about this doesnt add up
who is this guy
i dont remember sleeping on this bed
or reaching the god tier im pretty sure thats something id remember
so is he from the future
does this mean later im going to have to put this ugly goddamn suit back on
which i thought we both agreed id retired from the wardrobe forever
and then go back in time and sleep in this bed and get killed by me right now
do i have the stable loop right
then what
why wouldnt i be concerned about that
if we make mistakes then dead daves start piling up
and dead daves are the enemy remember
says the sword holding guy whos about to add one to the pile
who
ok i got it
i wonder if this can finally be the conversation that doesnt deteriorate into a lot of bitching and moaning about her
so if im understanding this
this guy isnt from the future who came back to finish a loop
and hes not from the past because id remember doing this
so this isnt part of our timeline choreography at all
must be from an offshoot timeline
which means hes doomed
ok so how did this happen where did we fuck up
what exactly did you do
_
104. TP15: =004992
yeah i remember
that seems like a long time ago already
what was that like more than a day for me chronologically 
ok but you didnt actually give me a choice
you just flipped a coin
_
105. TP16: =004993
ok stop that shit is probably like crack to you
im not going to stand by and watch you fall prey to your own wild cherry apeshit apocalypse
the arrangement being the coin flip thing
thank god we did that otherwise wed be screwed
i probably would have gone back in time and killed my own grandfather oh wait i never had one
oh yeah
twoface is a human batman villain whos half ugly and flips coins all the time to make evil decisions
its ok flippin coins for reasons is still pretty badass i guess
why dont you finish your story
_
106. TP17: =004994
right exactly
so like i said before i had no choice at all i picked some options and you flipped a coin
not seein it
i picked good heads to mean youd show me now
bad heads to mean youd show me later
you said it came up bad heads
so i was like ok i can wait
and i did for like a whole day
and now here you are showing me
did i miss something
_
107. TP18: =004995
then
this is kind of useless isnt it
i thought you were bringing me back here to finish a stable time loop not murder a guy you punked whos gonna die regardless
whats the fucking point of giving a doomed version of myself superpowers anyway
its just the worst thing when you get morbid
anyway maybe
but i kind of doubt thats how it works i mean
doomed means doomed doesnt it
the loopholes are only temporary like look how davesprite turned out
am i wrong in guessing that
shouldnt you know better than me
i dont know
what does being a seer of mind actually mean
oh ok its someone who asks a bunch of dumb riddles i figured it out already
lets not get derailed here
we were talking about a serious issue and im standing over my soon to be corpse while holding a fucking sword
punishing
i guess
_
108. TP19: =004996
i dunno none of this is making for a very persuasive argument that i should kill doomed me
see
this shit youre doing now
this is the morbid shit i was talking about
its not anywhere near as endearing as you probably think
even when you bracket smile after it
like ok you said something fucked up but hey theres a cute face my heart just fucking melted
ok yeah youre right i just got won back over totally
i think
this whole thing was a ruse
and not even the funny kind that qualify as distactions
i think you got my whole timeline there in front of you and you know damn well i have no intention of killing this guy ever
and its just a big game you set up to watch me squirm over weird mortality issues while you giggle
so
i guess
well played??????
i dont know
just one question
and please just drop your fucking justice riddles and be honest
do i ever make the god tier
like the right way
ok
then cool i guess i can live without wearing a sweet windsock hoodie and making time tornadoes or whatever
i was only bugging you about it cause you were being so vague
_
109. TP20: =004997
alright then
i guess thats enough of this horseshit time to move on right
i dont even want to be around when he wakes up itll be weird and awkward
no fuck no
put your fucking death coin away jesus
i am forbidding you from ever flipping that coin again when youre talking to me or even thinking about me
what you didnt
thats fucking idiotic
you could smell a flea off a dogs balls
this is bs
so ok your coinflip of death was meaningless great to know
is there anything else we need to do here
i sent you the money i got all the fraymotifs tell me what is there thats left besides you jerking me around
probably time we chill out for a while and i get back in sync with my teammates
then i guess thats where ill go
ok
i mean
im not even actually mad i just
i dunno
i still dont really get what you did
was the trick really necessary
it sounds like
the splitoff was a result of both possible decisions i could have made
and had fuckall to do with your coin or randomness or luck
get what
yeah
and
i obviously still dont know
i dont know sounds like a riddle
fuck it ill just say all of it
i mean that is the answer right
oh ok
really well
i know it biblically its an obscene nsfw spectacle
means my skull is a bucket and my brains a plump fuckgrub
oh do you
is that what you were doing just now
yeah no fuck
man
you are just
some kind of nowitall arent you
what else do you know
like
yeah because
you didnt even look
it was like
schrodingers fucking coin
and then
it turned into schrodingers fucking dave
yeah
what
_
110. JH26: =005041
yes perfect
ok im going to torrent you another like negative billion artifact grists
yeah
now draw the conksuckiest boot you ever drew
_
111. JH27: =005042
its the conksuckiest piece of fucking shit that ever still somehow qualified as a boot
you just know imigrants were responsible
yeah see what i mean
_
112. TP21: =005090
well that was apparently pointless
now what
hello
terezi
whats up
_
113. JH28: =005104
this is a dave out there whats up
it wasnt a future dave he was from a while ago
sorry you had to see that
but dont worry it was just a doomed dave no big deal really
i was swindled into splitting time paths along the way and that guy got the dead end of the stick
ill be fine
yes you are go ahead and be relieved
nice
yeah
hes pretty much the guy in charge of random teleportation murders right now
what
my bro
yeah jack killed him too
not much to talk about
this is some pretty serious existence threatening shit going down and some people are going to die i guess
even crazy hard dudes like my bro slash weird covert biological ghost dad
yeah roses too
i thought john filled you in on the ectobiology stuff
bottom line is were all related slimewise except you and me and him and rose pairways respectively
makes the shipping chart pretty simple here hang on while i dig up that piece of shit karkat made
where the fuck did that thing go
fuck it never mind
just imagine something ugly made by a jackass
i guess
meh it was a pretty bizarre relationship by any standard
fightin off wave after wave of face pumicing puppet ass every day
always being on guard for stealth attacks in the middle of the night while getting up to go to the fucking bathroom
but i guess it all sorta amounted to some vague unspoken semblance of kinship
if thats a thing
like if honor among thieves is something then lets call it camaraderie among ironic rapping roof ninjas
but thanks
i thought about taking his sword
when i was there
but i couldnt
couldnt really bring myself to try to pull it out it was too weird
what
you think
well id like to
but im still trapped in the chronologistics of this fuckin one man ballet
there are loops outstanding and if i step out of line you get to see more bloody daves
im getting pretty sick of it but i think itll be over soon
then ill break out and ride linear the rest of the way i think
once its time to put the end game in motion
til then youre on your own for a while
besides we cant beat him
look what he did to bro and davesprite together
im at the top of my echeladder with all the fraymotifs and i stand no chance
johns even better than that even though he doesnt know it at the moment
and he stands no chance either
only thing we can do is hold out until the scratch
guess i shouldnt really say
since you sort of lead the way in making that plan
yeah well
suffice to say
if we cant beat him
all we can really do is exile him to a place where he cant teleport back
which hopefully buys us some time
to try to take out his power source in a crazy suicide mission
kinda
well
youre about to do what youre about to do
and im not going to tell you not to
i wont do the bullshit troll thing and tell you what youre going to do and then just dare you not to
while knowing damn well you will anyway
so ill just say
whats next is up to you
and if later you want to talk about it
im here
_
114. AM1: =005381
hey
christ
youre a fan of one of my websites arent you
what asshole gave you my chumhandle
also what was your favorite thing i did you liked
and what did you think was so great about it
also
asl???
oh holy shit ok youre a troll
only trolls say theyre six i dont know whats up with you and that dumb fake age
makes no sense bye
cool story
ok so 2=6 awesome joke hahahaha
or wait maybe it was just a waste of time
you people think im made of the stuff
_
115. AM2: =005382
what
yeah
i think
im gonna shut off my phone now cya
uh
what
the fuck
i remember this
i remember shutting off my phone and never talking to you again
but
im still talking
whats going on
no its a dream
im asleep
or am i
what is going on here
why
bs
i dont see anything out there
_
116. AM3: =005383
oh sup
looks like youre a fairy
thats cool
_
117. AM4: =005384
these arent my shades anymore
john gave me these new ones for my bday
i remember that
and i wasnt wearing this shirt
it was this one
howd it get like that
i cant
wait
i wasnt wearing this actually
_
118. AM5: =005385
i was wearing this suit
no wait
it was a black one
yeah
and i was playing sburb
thats right
and then i went to sleep at some point
which is why im asleep now
but
if im dreaming
then why am i not awake as my dream self
shit
this wasnt the suit i was wearing
_
119. AM6: =005386
it was this ugly fucking rag
and i went to take a nap
terezi said id reach god tier
or i guess show me why i wouldnt
did it work is this part of the process somehow
so then
its just a stupid pointless dream
wait
oh yeah
i woke up
and then
_
120. AM7: =005387
welp
_
121. AM8: =005388
so then
im dead
then this isnt a memory or a dream at all
its the afterlife
_
122. AM9: =005389
ok
what is going on over here then
is this some disturbing ghost hallucination should i start slapping myself or what
i dont remember this
fuck
lucky bastard
so then i guess terezi tricked me
it would have been cool to know if picking one option would definitely kill me pointlessly so yeah
but i guess i kept giving her shit about it and i knew she was kind of crazy and morbid anyways so whatever
is
bro dead there
like in reality
like thats a thing that really happened
also
is reality still a thing that means something can that be a question on the table too
well
dammit
what did i do wrong
aside from getting my ass killed in the most retarded way possible
whats he doing
alpha me
i am him
i dunno
yeah
sorta
maybe
ok
am i talking to someone there
who
probably
terezi i guess
i dunno
would she do that
was i
so
im just one dead dave offered up to the time god
what about the other dead daves
uh
i think
im up to my neck in dave already
just being one
still doesnt seem right though
why are you even here like why are you showing me this
but like
if im seeing this
shouldnt i be able to do something about it
or stop it from happening or
i dont know like anything to keep helping my friends
what do i do
_
123. AM10: =005390
where are we now
oh so this is the trollplanet
pretty cool not really what i pictured
i dont know its more subdued
i pictured a lot more mayhem like
a bunch of trolls flying around in little grub pods constantly screaming at each other through bullhorns shaped like buckets
hahaha
can we not go to those parts
awesome
so what am i supposed to do now that im dead
what is like
the primary activity here
that ghosts get their shit worked up over
like
where are the fucking hauntoffs at is what im asking
boring
just kidding that sounds cool
what else
it isnt
ha
haha
i bet you meant a laugh a whole lot less shitty than that
yeah sure
well
how about later
not that that doesnt sound cool but i kind of want to just go home
and i guess chill for a while cause i guess it was all a bit much
if thats ok and i guess also possible
_
124. AM11; TN3: =005391
aw hell no
is this who i think this is
holy shit
dude
are those sick fires youre packing there
you best not be bringin that fire into my bubble less you plan on dropping that shit
i am your general fucking practitioner and doctors orders are to shut up and burn down my goddamn office
ill break your brittle ass like a graham cracker and well roast smores over the flaming debris have i made myself clear
dude
gross
so aradia just so were clear
this is like a hellbubble right
its my eternal punishment to have shitty rapoffs with this tool forever is that it
i guess i had it coming for a flagrant lifetime spent being unbelievably fucking incredible at rap and just about practically everything else
except not dying
so is he dead
he looks dead
what about you
you dont look dead
are you dreaming
so
youre not dead
_
125. TP22: =005598
oh my fucking god
what do you mean what
we just got done talking and agreed it would be awesome if you didnt bother me for a while
you know like while i guess i grieved over this brutally murdered rad family member or something
it was five seconds ago
so youre officially going nonlinear with me then
were just forfeiting all rhyme or reason to this unmitigated clusterfuck is that it 
whoops ok in the future ill try not to pitch any sort of dramatics while brooding over the cadavers of slaughtered loved ones
no
puppets arent cool theyre shitty small fake people who haunt your dreams and grin like permanent assholes
i was making a joke about being all broken up about it
a guy can be sad and make jokes at the same time
exactly
i said we agreed youd leave me alone to grieve
didnt say whether i actually would or actually am
i am grieving to the max like a widow on dead husband island
behind these chill as fuck shades my face is having this crazy attack of the sads
my rue is fucking bananas cant you tell
the truth is a mystery
tucked behind the pursed lips of a shitty riddler
they will be loosened only when presented with the conundrous grandeur of rigid insoluble puzzlecock
im sorry you are so flustered by the mere mention of glittering mythical cryptodick it honestly makes me think youre not ready for the truth
its pretty simple
im just thinkin about how im gonna take this sword
filthiest thing you ever said
forget it
pulling swords out of things isnt how i roll
im not john remember
im not a hereo
my bro was
john is
im not
no
fine its a title we inherit as phlegm babies or whatever but what have i done to earn it
pretty much nothing but horsing around through time and swindling retarded alligators out of their life savings
if that swords coming out of his chest its coming out clean
taking it vertically means drawing more blood
but horizontally means a clean break
check it
_
126. TP23: =005603
no fuck that
im a lie my ass right down here for a while looking slightly less cool than i make myself out to be ordinarily 
that is basically what i just did isnt it
thats what im doing here im making a point of makin every little thing take place what was once mentioned in passing no matter how seemingly trivial or pointless
thats how all the best adventures get strung together
you havent heard me bleat like a goat for ironically humorous purposes yet have you
that was something that was mentioned at some point by someone i forget when or why
i bet you are on goddamn pins and needles waiting for that arent you
no
fuck that
no
fuck you
go away
what
i dunno
why are you even talking to me anyway
aside from the fact that several hours from now you apparently forget i dont need consolation and oughta be left alone
oh
bitten
what
that sure sounds like a dumb way to say a thing
almost egbertian in elegant stupidity
the t in egbertian is soft like shhhhh
why would i get mad at you
ok
but yeah i guess its about time you showed me whats up with my allegedly futile god tierification
how long ago was it that you did your coin flip thing i dont even remember
i was getting sure you were just bullshitting me and had no intention of ever mentioning it again
for what
before what happens
you mean god tiering
does something go wrong
thats practically unthinkable
but i mean ok we can talk about your troll problem but this is pretty important here
the god tier thing and whether i can actually do it or not
it might be kind of hard to tell on account of me chilling face down on the pavement and also because downplaying feelings is the chief rule of cool but im pretty pissed about this
which is weird
no its not weird to be mad its just weird it feels like im the only one who is
and the only one even contemplating taking jack on
even among your group of irate gnashing shitheads
what
well ok
and that would be a bitchin line to switch the subject to start talkin about your complicated problems but i kinda wasnt done 
but ok i mean isnt that what heroes should be doing
working to take down the bad guy without a whole lot of this fuckin grandiloquence and these huge sweeping plans that got nothin to do with fighting him
like always biding our time and tiptoeing around the unbeatable god boss
johns too nice to get mad
rose spends all her time calculating
too focused on machiavellian ploys of sabotage to try anything drastic
jade is
i dont even know
probably more a liability if she got it in her head to take him down
if anything id bet she just needs protection
im just wondering
when does someone actually step up
jacks got shit to pay for
yeah i guess
i guess it has been on my mind
maybe i am supposed to be a hero and rise to the occasion because there seems to be this little persistent voice in my head nagging me about it
insisting someones gotta pay
and its hard for me to disagree
what things
_
127. TP24: =005604
im pretty sure i dont even have an exile
ive never heard any voices or anything
anyway you dont need a voice in your head to tell you this shit is
just like
so completely illegal
wait
why did i just say that stupid thing i said
_
128. TP25: =005605
no i mean
ok that came out wrong
what were we talking about again
right
someone has to make him pay
cant let him just go unpunished
if i can figure out how to reach the god tier maybe i can be the one to throw him into the slammer
slammer means jail
you call it the slammer when youre extra angry at crimes
_
129. TP26: =005606
are you taking notes on this important principle?? jesus get a fucking pen
or some chalk or whatever
wait
fuck
what
no
i know it doesnt
im just saying
what am i even saying here
shit
_
130. TP27: =005607
ok forget the slammer stuff that was stupid
it is about justice though
and since no one else seems to give a shit about that it apparently falls in my jurisdiction now
not just going after jack
but all the mutinous agents responsible for crimes
holy shit why do i care about THAT suddenly
anyway thats more shit that popped into my head just now
so
ok
_
131. TP28: =005608
not really
no
anyway
its not like being mad about this and hankering for justice is even the only irrational thing im currently hot and bothered about
i have other duties to attend to
_
132. TP29: =005609
ive got to explode this ridiculously illegal edifice oh my god what are these words im saying
never mind
oh
yeah
thats gotta be what im talking about
probably
i need to shut up now
im sounding like an idiot and my head is starting to hurt
why dont we talk about your thing now
what justice thing do you have to do
yes
just please tell me your justice problem and make me stop saying stuff
farewell
no i mean
god damn it im not leaving
farewell is not even a thing i would ever say jesus what am i a victorian poet
can you show me a little respect and assume any time i say something stupid it just means im temporarily being inexplicably retarded
thats what a real friend would do
_
133. TP30: =005610
thank you
that sounds awesome
justice problems
oh shit are you fucking serious
no i got that theyre like your alien death lawyers who were sorta like bounty hunters in olden times pretty simple to decipher through context
she
ok i cant even make little interrogative quips to grease the wheels of your monologue
_
134. TP31: =005611
spidertroll
youve decided to take her down then
you dont sound that psyched about it
are you feeling guilty
like second guessing whether she deserves it
hasnt she done enough terrible shit to warrant legislaceration
_
135. TP32: =005612
are you sure about that
there is no john vs dave thing though
are you going to stop me too then
hunt me down and lawyerviscerate me for my own good
are you saying that i wont make god tier or i wont be strong enough if i do
what
lame motion overruled the judge wants to see where this is going
ok fine
we can keep obsessing over your fucked up kismesister if you want
do you think she stands a chance against him
then whats the big deal
why not let her go get her shit ruined by jack and let justice happen that way
so why dont you go do it
you mean you cant beat her in a fight
i thought trolls were all about gratuitous murderings
are
you asking me to reassure you about that
cause i seriously dont have a clue
i dont understand
i thought you were insane kinds of apeshit over the macabre stuff
like being all cutesy about executions and smelling cherry blood and such things contrived to get a guy feeling vaguely uncomfortable
was that all an act
of course the fuck not
didnt you say youve killed people before
_
136. TP33: =005613
ok
id like to help you out but i dont know what advice i should be giving
to a member of a murderous species whos gunshy on going off to justicemurder a murderhappy murderer whose done lots of murders
it feels pretty weird and inappropriate for me to be the one to tell you fuck yes go for it shes got this huge murder with her name on it anyways and its cruising right at her down comeuppance boulevard
so i dont know
do you want me to tell you to be a better human
or to be a better troll
alright well all ill say is
maybe if you kill her at least we can finally stop obsessing over her
why dont you just do what you think you have to do
and ill do the same
speaking of which
these time shenanigans completely blindsided us they practically never even happen
so i hang up now with future you and then start pestering present you about it is that how it works
and i make sure not to reference anything said here to keep it simple
except like in an offhand way thatll seem retroactively logical to your future self
ie you right now
if for no other reason than itd be boring as hell to rehash it
does luck actually matter
_
137. RL24: =005776
heres one for you
its a whopper
are you ready
_
138. RL25: =005777
this huge fuckin whopper im about to just say
what
no no
ok first do you even have burger kings out in the fucking woods
why do you reference things that obviously arent in the woods like terrible burgers
there is
ok whatever
im talking about a dream i just had
i mean it was a doozy like psychologically speaking
doozy is a slightly dumber word than whopper
it was absurdly heavy handed my subconscious was really slathering it on
like whatever tangy sludge the king himself squirts on his bargain patties
its possible that i dreamt it ironically i dunno
i figured youd be interested in hearing about it its every bit as thick and juicy as a half pound of sizzling grade A premium ok this is stupid weve got to get burgers out of this conversation
are you busy
cool listen to this
_
139. RL26: =005778
no but this one is too good not to put under the microscope with your whole precocious psychotherapy shtick its almost laughably symbolic of all my mental problems assuming i actually have those
its grotesquely pregnant with meaning
all gestating at least 8 gooey octuplets thrashing around in an undulating belly full of mind slime 
no look
i just want your professional take on how many things in my dream symbolize dicks
yeah thats a given but i didnt even dream about puppets this time
i know
it was so much more relaxing and enjoyable
it was about me dying repeatedly
_
140. RL27: =005779
i was in this dark place surrounded by this big flock of crows
god this is so generically morbid
im sorry in advance for exposing you to my unconscious minds retarded cliches
well obviously i knew the birds were just black screaming sky dongs just hear me out
i kept dying
there kept being these traps like i would go one way and get my head chopped off
or go another way and get stabbed or whatever
and every time i died the dream reset itself and i was standing there alive and ready to try to escape again
but each time i would be watching myself from the vantage point of a different crow
like i was the crow all squawking around in circles like a macabre flapping douche
and i would always watch myself try to do something different to dodge the trap but i always ended up dead
you mean maybe its about anxiety over maintaining my blogs
or that my beats might not be ill enough
and then we crack up laughing cause we both know theyre fresher than your moms change of drawers and tighter than when shes wearin them
please its not like shes my mom i can visualize her choice ass all i want without it gettin much more than moderately uncomfortable for everyone involved
about what
uh
this isnt the first time youve insinuated were related what is up with that
no
i mean
im not sure
i feel like youve brought it up before which is kind of weird but now i dont know
i think im getting this weird deja vu thing where i was sure we talked about this
forget it
ok
so i kept dying and kept being crows and stuff
and then i started to notice something coming from the sky
it was this faint eerie singing and i look up and theres nothing there just darkness
what did you read
what the fuck sort of crackpot psychology text would say something like that
so then youre consulting astrology books now
oh my fucking god will you put that away
theres not even much more to it
i looked up into the sky
didnt see anyone singing
but even though the sky was black i could see the sun
it was bright as hell even through my shades
so i flapped my wings and flew up away to it like a fucking piece of garbage
and thats it
no
not in the sense that it was a dark sacrificial zoology mission
it was more like somewhere to go besides watching myself die a lot from the vantage of a feathery murder of dumb shitty birds
what the fuck are you talking about
ok somethings wrong
this whole conversation is falling apart this isnt how it originally went at all
this happened months ago
does this mean im dead
_
141. RL28: =005780
stop it
this is so sick you using the dream bubble bullshit to pick apart my psyche
am i dead or asleep
god dammit
yeah right
i dont know
_
142. RL29: =005796
i remember waking up here
after getting shot
then the cage bunny came
he gave us the bomb
whered he go anyway
the bunnys a she
dumb
we were talking about who should go
no
wait
wasnt i going to go
is that what happened did i go and now im dead
whats not quite
that i didnt go or that im not dead
no
sure
i did that
because i wanted to
and because i was supposed to
yeah i saw my future self fighting him so obviously that had to happen or else id be dead anyway
without even getting the satisfaction of standing up to him
hard to explain
with all the time shit going on
i dont try to understand your light shit do i
havent we had this conversation already
its jogging i guess
its manboobs are jiggling a little
what
what am i really supposed to say
hey were gonna hunt frogs til you shoot me through the jack
then i die and youve got to make out with me
that kind of changes how the whole thing goes doesnt it
what does that even mean
wtf
aspd
oh no
this conversation just got bumrushed by a mudslide of fucking awful
you dont know anything
about what i was feeling or what happened on lofaf
you were all pavement faced and babbling your throefester speak and flipping off the shit with your own crazy deathwish thing why do you think you know what was going through my head
youre just assuming and throwing around psyche buzzwords like aspd complex disorder
in your case probably
its some delirious biznasty alright
yes ima authorize a GOD DAMN you may swipe it at the door to check yourself into the burn ward
nah those are kept in emergency reserve for yo mama jokes from the 90s
anyway
im telling you if i said anything at all about it she probably doesnt even fire her gun once and all im doing is dragging her into a doomed timeline with me
none of this is that big a deal
i just mentioned the basics to her
that id stop time traveling soon
break out of the loops
not have to wonder all the time if i was taking a wrong turn and dooming everybody
i was never that cool with this
you know how you turned out to be this incredibly shitty seer of light and basically failed at that in every way imaginable 
well maybe i never wanted to be a knight of time
maybe id rather just be like
the dave of guy
you know just some dude
i guess not
guess i failed my quest then
so im like
now what bitches
to nobody in particular i guess
yes those exact bitches
_
143. RL30: =005797
oh yeah
i remember that now
then i guess thats what happened
i delivered the bomb and now i must be dead
is that wrong
because i made the map so i know how to get there better
ok if you remember it all so clearly why are you grilling me on this shit
will you just tell me whats going on 
well i am
because i should
or should have
man what the fuck is going on
am i dead or are you dead or what
uh
oh yeah
we were trying to figure out a way to detach the moon
so i could pilot it out there
fly it into the sun
_
144. RL31: =005798
but the chain was huge
couldnt think of how to break it
then out of nowhere this sword appears in the thing
so im thinking obviously i have to break the sword somehow
because thats all i fucking do is break swords
_
145. RL32: =005799
but as im thinking of how to do it i put my hand on it
and it just snaps off with this comical shattering noise
like i just fucked up some priceless shit in the louvre
_
146. RL33: =005800
see like that
like i did again just there with my hand
cause of dreambubbles
remember when that happened
_
147. RL34: =005801
then i took it and sliced the chain
like this
damn
it still cuts like its plowing through a shaft of boneless zombie meat
whoops
yeah
_
148. RL35: =005802
so then
the moon started drifting away
and i was going to fly up
and take it to the sun
and i said something to you
or i was going to
like say bye or something
but you were just standing there not saying anything
holding that ball of yarn
_
149. RL36: =005803
and then
oh
god thats right
_
150. RL37: =005804
come on
knocking me out so you can steal the suicide mission
god dammit
that is so trite
its like
heres how bad this is
were are basically bruce willis and ben affleck from johns shitty crappy movie
you made this even more armageddon than it already was
sealing me in the air lock so i can go home to liv tyler and have the most terrible babies with her
the bunny or the actress
you not knocking me out with a ball of fucking yarn is fucking what
this probably comes close but that doesnt make it not lame as hell
its cool you are so tickled by this i hope it brought you a lot of rad laughs on your way to go fucking explode 
so thats it
im actually lying here on derse asleep
and you went out there and blew up the sun
and now youre dead and im dream chilling with your smug ghost
so youre not dead
then youre dreaming
what youre taking a little nap on the moon in the middle of nowhere
_
151. RL38: =005837
ok
so all those questions you asked me
getting me to remember
you were just stalling me werent you
so i wouldnt wake up and try to stop you
this sucks
could you just please turn the thing around and come back
we agreed id do it though
or at least you pretended to agree
just before going into a major league wind up with your nap yarn
sports
all im saying is
no one likes a basketball hog
i just think you should know
that in the athletic arena of competitive achievement
its a widely known fact that cherry picking posers get showered in nothin but boos
you dont gank the rock and steal the big mans thunder on his raucus drive to the hole
is that the sort of ignominy you want
see you didnt consider sports you never consider the sports 
and yet
such has been whats happened
it like the tight end was going long down the yard in sudden death
its me im the tight end
and the quarterback sniped the fieldgoal just before the nfl buzzer went off
the greedy qb is you
but instead of winning the gold sports prize you just fucking die and nobody cares and it didnt mean anything
the football prize
no come on
its called the bruce bombardi trophy or something
for best pile squad
and even though youre dead all these fat millionaires in helmets just leap on your corpse anyway and pile up and i mean WAY up
the sport pile doesnt stop from getting taller
what do you care youll be dead like the mission thieving poser you are
yes poser it should be my torso getting pulverized by that avalanche of overpaid beefcakes and you know it 
there obviously stopped being a difference between those things the question is offensive
almost as offensive as you stalling me while you peel out of here in your dumb moon 
yeah but i dont know how to wake back up is the thing
how do i wake back up
_
152. RL39: =005838
ok then do it
but this was my mission
that doesnt make sense
why would they drag me into it just to have me make a map and then let you ditch me
theyve obviously been gunning for me too
why do you think that
but i dont want you to die
this isnt right
so you admit you were stalling with all that bullshit
what do you mean
............ 
what
sure
but
if im promising not to chase you down then theres not really any hurry to wake up
nah ill stay asleep a while
what did you want me to tell john
what
no what
_
153. RL40: =005839
whos this douche dag
i mean bag

horrorcore
lame clown rap and stuff
dude are you an actual juggalo or not
hahahahaha
do you really not know what im talking about
ahaha
i cant even tell if youre trying to troll me with this or if you actually are having some weird emotional problem
ok im telling you
you need to watch this video
the song isnt even supposed to be released for another year or something
but i got it from an inside source
this is as hot as it gets
hang on lemme dig it up
_
155. GM3: =005931
none of that really meant anything but ok
also you have me confused for somebody else we never talked
i guarantee i would have remembered you
thats cool juggalo guy who i still cant quite tell is ironic about this or not
but like i said either way its all good
what
what fears
oh god
did my bro put you up to this
i should have guessed he might have a hand in some of these shitty trolling escapades
hahaha jesus
you are fucking insane
so
my bros idiotic ventriloquist dummy is responsible for this schizophrenic bullshit
is that what youre saying
what else does he say
welp
that sounds about right
better do what he says dude

yes a thing
shut up
what about you have you seen her
are you serious
of course not
i havent see that guy at all since the first day we got here
not once
talk about an elusive juggalo
probably like the shyest fuckin juggalo of all time
im pretty sure only karkats seen him
dont expect him to rat him out either because of the "morail" junk
moirail?
mwah rail...
alien words
yeah
i mean i bet you think youre imparting some really obscure cultural fact about trolls
but really if a human said to another human
"hey man can you tell me where your best clown friend is hiding so i can go chainsaw him to death"
just fyi that would probably be bad form too
i dunno its been a year already i think hes really intent on hiding
and hanging on to those dead bodies
hes probably scared to death of you at this point anyway
maybe you should just let it go
rose back me up

wait
are you saying this is like
a spade quadrant thing
is she trying to be his kismet fish
well if she hates him isnt that what that means

we looted one of them for the can town project

since you can see the future
yes you can
you totally can
no thats totally dumb
i could know things about the future if i time traveled and found out first hand
nobodys mistaking that about me im a time traveler not a fuckin fortune teller its simple as shit
ok whatever
nice
uh
now?
yeah that would be pretty legit of us
ok i didnt really catch any of that bullshit cause i wasnt listening
im gonna make myself a cup of coffee and get primed to listen to you saying a lot of stuff like that
do you want some
_
169. KM4: =006599
kanaya?
ok
...
this fuckin thing
where did you even unearth this piece of shit from
_
170. RL50: =006600
oh ok there it goes
two hot revitalizing cups of shitty coffee
fresh out of the weird pod
why do we even drink this shit
i guess just cause this thing is here
like somehow the temptation is even stronger because the coffee sucks?
dunno how the fuck that works
wish there was such a thing as apple juice on troll world
could go for a bottle of aj
i wonder if theres any booze squirreled away on this meteor
kinda feels like we should be drinking our asses off here
no adults nothing to do
thats what you do without adults right
get wasted all the time?
wait what the fuck am i saying trolls dont even have adults
well they do
but theyre all in outer space being insane badasses
i guess they do have the stupid nanny monsters
do the monsters give a shit if they get wasted 
what
oh
off the shit is how
all being like
in cups and everything
_
171. RL51; KM5: =006601
so whats with the big book youre writing in
is that more wizard fan fiction
so its like
your nigh unreadable gamefaq
in tome form
you sure like to write big game guides
i guess
ehh
chances of that seem pretty remote
ok totally sold on that suddenly
on account of not caring
so tell me about the new session
what is there to know
and most importantly
how is everything going to go wrong this time
ok but i thought the whole point of this
the scratch thing
is it gave us a chance to still win
but youre saying the new session has a fault too? 
_
172. RL52: =006602
ok
which is what
weird
why would these alt universe players fuck up in such an obvious and stupid way
didnt you say at some point that not prototyping anything would be really bad
_
173. RL53: =006603
still waiting to hear how this is in any way an improvement on all the shit we just escaped from 
jade has our battlefield right
so she shows up and drops it in skaia
and then we take the result of all that damn frog breeding we did and stick the thing in there somehow
and we sit back and wait for it to do its huge ribbit or whatever
and were golden
_
174. RL54: =006604
is that going to be a problem
ok but
conspiracies aside
did it ever really look like clear sailing to you
thats not what i was seeing
we are going to arrive and then soon after jack is going to show up
and then we have to beat him right
so there kind of is a time limit
_
175. RL55: =006605
oh
why not
so
no meteors came at all
you mean by fucking up and having to scratch we also sort of saved earth in the process 
i see
what about the players themselves
they had to arrive on meteors too didnt they
i guess the baby meteors were some exceptions too right 
_
176. RL56: =006606
................
what do you mean tweak the destination times
where did they get sent to
what
_
177. RL57: =006607
uh
so
uh
in this alt universe group of us and
them
which ones are the actual players
fuck
why did i know that was gonna be the answer
i dunno if im ready to process the ramifications of this bullshit
_
178. RL57; KM6: =006608
man
at least im used to dealing with alt daves
ive been fuck deep in alt daves before
its a goddamn delight if you want to know the truth
but i dont even know what to think about...
lets not even talk about it ok
can we slow down this meteor
delay the meetup
maybe fight jack for a little while 
but your mom was just a nice alcoholic spinster who liked wizards who you complained about for no reason
she wasnt anything like an untouchable master of irony who could replace the meat in your sandwich before it even occurred to you what the fuck you were chewing
let me ask you this did your mom ever wiggle a puppet in your face even ONCE 
fine well you can be on bro duty then
ill be the ambassador to your mom
and no that wasnt actually meant as the sick burn it sounded like 
yeah i know
ill be the ambassador to my mom then
that sounds pretty stupid when i say it that way
whatever
ill be the fuckin one man welcome wagon for the john and jade teen old people and also our mom thats the plan
so when we finally see them we can get our shit into formation like trained acrobats
like ill blow a whistle and we make a human pyramid got it
that way we can totally avoid anything awkward 
what
when
wait that was her
oh
huh
.....
no
god fucking dammit
no what a load of shit
stuff said between you and me before we knew we were related
we both know that was a lot of horseplay bullfuckery between like smartass 10 year olds or whatever
you cant seriously have taken any of that seriously 
ugh dont ever do that
all these fuckin
momtraps and sistertraps
what a joke i hope skaia gets to have a good laugh over shit like this
wait i forgot skaia doesnt laugh it just "sees" and "knows"
its like a huge blue perv thats mad jazzed for kidcest 
dont you wink at her
kanaya heres a protip that wink meant jack dick shes just being weird
yeah im pretty much olyying outie too
got some shit to attend to
after you
_
179. KV10: =006609

we have one of those???
yeah i remember

dude
you know youre only pretending to be a huge fan of his bullshit to piss me off

_
183. KV14: =006613

you are not drawing a grid to organize our goddamn dating lives
that is some straight up crackpot motherfuckin noise i will not abide
stop drawing the shipping grid
you will not draw anything that even remotely resembles a grid
_
186. KV17: =006616
do not draw an arrangement of squares or otherwise interlocking polygons
you will not draw a spreadsheet for the purpose of allocating time spent with a mutual girlfriend you horses ass
that is exactly the shit i do not want to see
no
stop
do not draw any additional squares
do not draw any quadrilaterals or trapezoids or rectangles or fucking n-drangles and especially as fuck not any god damned rhombuses
i dont want to see your lines making any right angles do you understand 
no
that is the perfect example of what you shouldnt be drawing 
no
no you fuck
put the goddamn pen down
you piece of shit
yes
_
187. KV18: =006617

209. RL66: =007303
dammit
rose dont drink so loud its messing up my raps
i can actually hear your sips through my headphones 
oh my god
you are so fucking hammered
how strong did you even make that stuff
_
210. RL67: =007304
pretty strong
rose you just bootlegged some fucking rubbing alcohol
faculity isnt a word check mate
this kinda strikes me as a sort of misappropriation of alchemy
like fucking with the mystical technology of creation to whip up some moonshine just seems
i dunno man
tell me you at least alchemized a bathtub first to stir this shit in
at least that would be hilarious
and where the FUCK is my applejuice rose
gotta say
you really let me down on the aj front
bullshit it was hard
whats so hard about applejuice its like
the most basic goddamn juice
like the square one of juice
uh
well shit
looks like i wandered into a really weird uncharted side of town tonight
its called the drunk rose district
and i am scared out of my fucking mind
no!
i told you i dont want any of your experimental fucking spacewizard booze
id rather not go blind
then terezi will have to teach me to lick shit to see
is that what you want do you want me licking everything in sight
like oh hey mayor SLURP oh fuck youre not the mayor youre my goddamn sister
_
211. RL68: =007305
oh my god
you laughed way too hard at that it wasnt anywhere close to that funny
i think youve had enough
good lord
i still dont know why you were so bent on making this liquor
i thought you werent really that down with the drinkin
you never liked it when your mom drank what happened to that
ok so why
why tonight do you just decide to get completely wasted before you
like
are you nervous about your date with kanaya is that it
uh
yes
rose
you are wearing a friggin prom dress
and nervously drinking your ass off
while you are waiting for kanaya to arrive
for a goddamn DATE
this is infuriating
why do you even bother with this stupid charade
you could be at like a drive in movie making out with each other
all exchanging class rings while giving birth to each others fucking children
and you would still be all coy like IS IT A DATE OR ISNT IT HMMMM WHO CAN REALLY SAY FOR SURE???
yeah
that turned out to be one hell of a sip
maybe you should just reschedule
just sleep it off there are more hot dates where that came from
im just not sure youre gonna make the best impression like this
come on lets just find you a suitably soft pile of objects to sleep in before she
aw shit
shes here
_
212. RL69: =007306
omfg i cant even deal
(rose i think you started drinking way too early)
(i think you just like)
(completely fucking forgot to tell kanaya you were dressing up)
(man youre gonna make her so uncomfortable all dolled up like that not to mention three sheets to the fucking wind)
(this date is going to be so awkward)
(yeah sure)
(SMH)
_
213. RL70; KM10: =007308
holy shit we got a room full of smooth operators here tonight
yes kanaya it was going to be a romantically oriented date
but as you can see rose is hooched to the fucking max
so i think youre better off going out another time
ugh
you seriously still wanna go through with this
a problem
uh
i dunno if youre cool with your date slurring words and making no damn sense about apples then
i guess not???
why are you both looking at me
stop that
no dont
hey i am not your fucking life coach here
if you want to go on a drunkdate what do i care
man what do i even know about "human courtship" anyway
not like i ever dated a fuckin human
so i guess have at it

214. KV29: =007835
my pants
what are you talking about
theyre on my legs
oh
what
for rose?
uh yeah kind of
man terezi doesnt need an intervention
she just drinks a lot of soda
its red fizzy shitwater dude who cares
terezi has made her choices
among them was to begin guzzling untold liters of that putrid circus cola
think of it as like a rite of passage
like something that just goes with the territory when someone you know almost imperceptibly begins turning into a juggalo
wait fuck
maybe she does need an intervention
did you try kicking her
im out of ideas
_
215. KV30: =007836
man i dunno
sounds like you wanna make this needlessly melodramatic
speaker crab
man dont put me on speaker crab
god
honestly she can do whatever she wants i put this all behind me a while ago
why do you really want me in on this conversation is it just that you dont know what to say by yourself
what
hahaha thats what you think that does?
no dude thats not what gift of gab does
its utility isnt really comprehensible to lowly mortals sorry
nah
_
216. KV31: =007837
what do you actually want from her
do you want her to stop drinking faygo and falling asleep in puddles of red fructose corn slobber
or do you want her to somehow address the root of those habits and cut all that out for good
yeah i can understand where youre coming from
but in situations like this i think you need to remind yourself theres only so much you can do for somebody
and maybe they arent going to want or need your help and you just have to figure out how to deal with that
like at some point in your life one of your friends might start spending all her time with a guy you think is bad news
and you have to decide if you need to intervene as a friend or just let it go because people can change or drift apart or whatever because thats just something that happens
look all im saying is
there comes a time in every young womans life when she has to come to terms with the decision to gradually morph into a juggalo while all her friends and loved ones watch in dismay
terezi has strolled through the dark carnival and taken a great brooding whiff of that decisions festive asshole and the choice she has made is all too clear
shes down with the clown
its true man
you can live in denial for only so long
but as your bro i have to say it like it is
she and gamzee man
that is literally a thing
they are in the hate square together
total kismespades dude
oh
really?
then what the fuck have i been tiptoeing around all this time god damn
i thought this was supposed to be like this "big secret" that would "destroy you" if you found out
then why is it a problem now
what
like i said i just put it behind me
she started sneaking around in vents and stuff acting suspicious trying to hide the fact that she was seeing him
like she was obviously ashamed of it and worried how id react
but it was hella transparent that was going on so i just said
thats fine yall can do your blackrom thing with the juggalo its your decision
but i cant keep playing along
i cant do the quadrant thing its just too weird for me
im not a troll and im not all open minded about gettin multicultural
i still dont understand the spades thing and it makes me really fuckin uncomfortable even trying to imagine how that works and i sure as fuck dont want to date anybody whos got a hateclown on the side
so i said no hard feelings i still like you and all, do whatever makes you happy ill just be over here in the hyper gravity chamber training to beat lord english
no
but what about you
havent you been talking to gamzee this whole time
or is he just balls out lying to you about sneakin around the meteor with terezi
i thought moirails were supposed to be open with each other about stuff like that
oh shit
sorry to hear about that
amazing i spent three years on this rock and never said one thing to the guy
i saw him once tho
just a glimpse in a dark hallway
it was kinda like seeing a blurry purple bigfoot with a huge boner
why is he wearing it
ahahaha the best thing we ever do together is slam this assholes dumb religion
really its the most hilarious fucking horseshit ive ever heard
i mean pretty much all religions are wrong but theres wrong and then theres WRONG
as in ZERO CHANCE YOU ARE EVER PROVEN RIGHT ABOUT EVEN A SINGLE THING DUDE, EVER EVER EVER
be one sad clown that day
his bulge will probably deflate and make this high pitch noise plus corresponding flatulence
what do you mean as friends
uh
yeah?
no offense dog but thats a dumb and neurotic question
you forgot the mayor
youre pretty damn tight with the mayor arent you
yeah the mayor rules
but as usual you are overcomplicating this
just like you overcomplicate everything
friendship leadership romance
shipping grids and dick battles
this is real simple
our meteor will somehow tokyo drift to a dead stop in the new session
at which point we will keep being bros for life or something
i will start being friends with john and jade again because they are my friends and never stopped being that
john will also be your friend because hes cool and also a doofus who is easy to be friends with
jade will be your friend too cause shes nice and likes being friends with people
i can personally guarantee that she will be happy to see you
and as for the new people i dont know about them but theyll probably be your friends too
all i know is two of them are my parents and two of them are johns parents and aint no rule that says you cant be friends with your bros mom and pop
especially when your bros mom and pop are a couple of sassy teens
as for terezi i dont know i guess well see what happens
and as for gamzee fuck that guy with a balloon poodle
friendship lesson secured the end

yeah dude you should probably ditch the chair
or at least sit on it frontways
or offer her another chair?
i dunno its kind of a dumb affectation in this context
to sit on the goddamn floor
so you can be on the same vertical plane with your friend while you exhibit compassion for her grody clown problem
karkat just threw a tantrum about a chair
i just won karkat tantrum bingo
_
218. KV33; TP39: =007919
where did you even get that chair
did you steal it from the common area
sounds like communism
are you a communist or something
actually that makes perfect sense what with your sickle and all
wait john has a hammer oh shit its all adding up
when we arrive are you going to team up with john and seize the means of production
im just saying
first chairs what next
see i am all about private property and pocketing dough
do you have any idea how rich i am
i am a man of MEANS motherfucker
just dont come after my boonies dude
or should i say karkat marx
i dont have much to say about this
ive kinda got to recuse myself on the matter
im all kinds of on record as being squicked out by the idea of hatelationships
so i got no point of reference for gauging when one is fucked up the way thats normal for trolls or if its fucked up cause its actually fucked up and terrible
this is like some ex alien boyfriend prime directive shit
i cant intervene cause i dont know what im talking about
but you do so i guess keep going
you were saying some pretty good stuff before i started riding your jock about chairs
thank you
intermission
its not an intervention either
my ghostly heads all beamin out of this crab for moral support yo
i am in my homies corner even if he is a massive socialist
terezi i think can probably figure this out
she grew up alone and blind in a forest i think she will manage to bounce outta her juggalo phase
but yeah terezi you should at least quit the fuckin soda
_
219. TP40: =007921
what
dont blame me
i cant control the crab
_
220. KV34: =008124
so
has anyone figured out how were actually gonna stop this meteor
or was three years not enough time to solve that problem
i dont think thats possible dude
in fact im not sure we were ever traveling at light speed
i think maybe theres been some bogus science in circulation that we been chumped into gettin behind
just saying
_
221. KV35; RL71: =008125
man pull it together
this thing has to have some escape pods or something
or i guess maybe we could
just sort of
hop up
and
like...
fly away?
i swear to god
this meteor needs one of those baby on board things on the back
but like a grub instead of baby for max fidelity to the gag because TROLLZ
i know you cant fly dude obviously i would just carry you or something
rose shut the fuck up
_
222. KV36; KM11: =008126
dude did you just bark
why would i bark
because youre having a mental breakdown
nah
wasnt me
kanaya did you bark
you fuckin with us maryam
maybe the mayor barked
mayor was that you
haha i bet it was
god i love the mayor hes so full of surprises

223. KV37: =0008180
hey
i hope this isnt too dumb a question but
do you have any idea how i got here
lohac
its my old planet
you know with the lava and shit
remember?
it has dumb crocodiles
and a stock market
or at least it used to have one
dunno if they locked it down since that time i literally ransacked the entire economy
where are you
lofaf?
land of frost and frogs
yeah it melted
no
i mean i doubt it you probably just cant see any right now
can you hear any ribbits
yes
probably
how long have you and kanaya been on lofaf
talkin to her rn
lohac
and yeah im with the mayor
yes
yeah
dunno i just am
not that i am complaining one bit the mayor as always rules categorically
(fyi i just hi fived him for like the third time in a row to my recent recollection)
so whats the last thing you actually do remember
right
me too
but she was like a fuckin werewolf or something
wait
then she zapped us to that stonehenge place
yeah
we all landed in some grass like a pile of fuckups
and then
damn
then what happened
what the hell happened to john
_
224. KM12: =008181
so are you just as brain damaged as we are
me and karkat
ok
so you have no idea how you got to lofaf then
im talking to karkat
yeah but i dont think thats the memory loss issue thats just him being an idiot
but lets not get into that
wheres rose
oh
what about terezi
do they remember what happened
what
how
friggin seers
all makin us knights look bad
and whatever you are
what were you again
what the dick is a sylph
but witches are already magical arent they
like by definition
oh wait thats the joke i guess
god damn this missing time shit is makin me feel dumb as hell
ok good
so what do the seers think happened
oh god
is she still drunk
ok
wow youre right
haha wtf
man i cant even describe it
its not just that her text is unreadable gibberish
i mean it is
but its more than that
its like
existentially inscrutable somehow
i think we may have a problem here
_
225. RL72: =008182
rose
whats up
yeah so i heard
kanaya tells me you think you know what happened
wanna give me the scoop
damn she wasnt kidding
this is surreal
yeah i cant understand a word youre saying
_
226. =008202
so weird being back here
cant believe how long ago it feels since i lived in this place
spent way too long wallowing in our own filth on that gnarly meteor thats for sure
this doesnt even seem like my room anymore
its like trespassing or something like im horning in on somebody elses life
a life lived most sweetly though i will admit
ahahaha the fuckin toilets still there
i remember when jade put that there that is perhaps like my favorite memory
wish jade wasnt crazy just makes me remember how much i miss not crazy jade
or less crazy jade
wait
didnt karkat once say terezi ripped a troll toilet out of his house
what is with girls and their universally constant tendency to rip out plumbing fixtures
did i just accidentally crack another cosmic riddle or
i gotta txt him and get confirmation on this asap
actually nah
i probably harangued the poor guy with enough of my bs the last few years
ill just keep shufflin thru memory lane making wistful observations out loud
you know it kinda chaps my bulge that people rip on me for talking to myself
its like the most perfectly natural thing to do
why are people so up tight about keepin a lid on their monologues what a bunch of stuffy pricks
ive always found the sound of my own voice to be mysteriously soothing
haha talk about an embarrassing sentence to say in earshot of an actual person
well maybe not the mayor
you can always tell the mayor anything <3
_
227. =008203
hahaha this piece of shit is still here too
didnt we use this thing like ONCE
what a useless pile of trash in hindsight
sometimes i think this game was designed by an idiot
wasnt it called like
the laserbeam intellivision or something
id throw it in the lava but that would be a waste of melting
_
228. =008204
oh yeah
almost forgot about my ill beats from the past
i wonder if theyre as ill as i remember
ok i just pushed some buttons and verified they remain as ill as the day they were dropped
ill have to send them to karkat he has always been an enthusiastic patron of my exceptional science
i mean sure he says it sucks and maybe he even believes that on some pathetic sub intellectual plane of consciousness which gross philistines operate on their whole lives
but whenever he gets a load of my hype
i see him there
tapping his foot ever so slightly
i see him
_
229. =008205
this poster...
love this poster
its like an old friend
never even knew who these guys were or what their deal was
never gave it much thought i guess
doubt ill ever find out at this point
oh well
some things i guess were never meant to be figured out
or benefit from any kind of elaboration
not even years later
just the way it is sometimes
its like ive said before
this poster is a hell of a mystery
that i never even thought was a mystery
and it would be pretty cool if somebody solved it
but damn if thats ever gonna happen
so thats a shame
_
230. =008206
aw hell its my old dead things collection
what a stupid blast from the past
i seriously cannot remember if i was sincere with this shit
i was probably trying to flex my underdeveloped irony muscles
like the shrimpiest kid at the hipster gym
why does my childhood room have to be such a predictable museum of embarrassments
i dont know
some of these things are kind of cool actually
like from a standpoint of objective reevaluation afforded by the sobering maturity that comes with being literally 100% grown up now
dead things are actually pretty rad
i feel like if i was legitmately into all this then more should have come of the interest
like there could have been like
entire CONVERSATIONS about it that never even took place
hey rose youll never guess what im excited about and have loads of dialogue to spill over
whats that dave
ancient mollusks
hmmmmmmmm said rose
how many bananas do you think this paw clutched back when it was alive and attached to a monkey
dave i really must say
this conversation blows
yeah sorry
maybe i could have really developed this interest
maybe i could have been something cool as a result
like what even profession is this
a dead shit ogler?
no wait
probably a paleontologist or something
i could have been a paleontologist
instead of what i became
which was
uh
some pajama packing fuckface from the renaissance fair
that would have been the dopeness!
_
231. =008207
eurgh
the ironic selfies
oh god
now this
this is some irredeemably mortifying shit here
what was i thinking
i dont know man
i just dont know
this is what seasoned veterans call "bad irony"
look at this guy
what a fucking novice
_
232. =008208
oh who am i kidding
i cant stay mad at that face

whoa
john
what
no
i mean i was just laughing too hard at something dumb
you know how it is
no its nothing
where the fuck have you been
do you remember what happened since we got here
well
are you gonna fill me in or keep floating there in the most uninformative way possible
what
why
john wait
_
239. JE28: =008216
no dont
john no stop turning into wind you fickle idiot
dont just leave right away that is such an insanely predictable move
i said get back here you slippery motherfucker!!!
_
240. GJ1: =008217
god dammit
_
241. GJ2: =008218
no
look all i know is egbert most definitely didnt just appear out of nowhere and catch me weeplaughing at my selfies
i keep my apparment misted with his odor at all times
essence d'egbert 
no like the french pronunciation
anyway im just a lot more comfortable when my whole place reeks of nerd musk
so that explains that 
you did
_
242. GJ3: =008219
where
_
243. GJ4: =008220
what work
what
you mean the deringer
i thought it was like the best possible sword
or at least the best possible broken sword
uh
not really?
lots of ways
we could have a jade goes back to normal party
starring normal jade
ok here
_
244. GJ5: =008221
how do we make it so it can damage him
and you know what that is
how
i dont understand how this is working
is she piping all these secrets into your brain
along with the evil
fair enough
i guess technically almost nothing is relevant to the dude youre barking orders to
literal barking because of dogginess
yes exactly like that
thank you for participating in the joke
now what is this special ingredient and where do we get it
oh yeah?
_
245. GJ6: =008222
no
no!
ive never seen that thing before
i didnt take your lousy egg
yeah well these planets are crawling with brainless lizards maybe one of them thought it was an egg
and then brought it here cause its warm here and tried to hatch it
what things
what are you talking about
come on dont compare me to him
just cause i think its an eggy looking thing dont mean i think like a damn bird
.....................
do you actually want snausages
ok well snausages notwithstanding this is bullshit
tell me how that thing doesnt look like an egg to you
how is that not so obviously SUCH an egg???
i see
so if im following
then what youre trying to tell me is
lord english has some sort of severe egg allergy that we are hoping to exploit
can we just make the eggsword already
_
246. GJ7: =008223
oh no
not the legendary piece of shit again
its the fuckin welsh sword again!
i dont know!
because i have a shitty quest is how
didnt davesprite tell you anything
i found this sword in a gold cave and broke it
then davesprite took it to hephaestus who fixed it and upgraded it to the deringer
and sent that to me and i broke it again
i know!!!
that has always been my thing for some reason
now i guess it turns out my ultimate sword is really just a repaired downgrade of my previously ultimate sword mixed with a cueball?
we just cycled right back to caledfwelsh like a bunch of tools
that is the most stupid convoluted ass backward way to get a sword out of a stone i can even imagine
i feel like somebody somewhere is having a good laugh over this i sure hope like the juggalo equivalent of fuckin loki or whoever the fuck is having a top notch riddlewank at my expense
you know what really gets me is
this shitty welsh sword presumably consisted of those ingredients all along which just makes me want to travel back in time to perform a mutually assisted suicide with myself
me and other dave can take turns suffocating each other with our own DUMBASS capes
jade this is STUPID
my quest is a STUPID PIECE OF GARBAGE QUEST for LAME SHITTY LOSER FUCKHEADS WHO SUCK BALLS WHILE CRAPPING THEIR PANTS
...
i need help :(
_
247. GJ8: =008283
why
wait since when could you use a sword
also
whats up with that dumb sword
how
ohh
yeah no
i climbed a few yeah
which ones do you have
show me your badges and you can see mine
i want to scope out this universal specibus badge that sounds pretty cool actually
oh yeah
its pretty easy to forget sometimes tho
i think were getting sidetracked by the kiddie camper shit
are you really suggesting that we do an actual sword fight right now
like for training purposes
_
248. GJ9: =008284
will you cut it out with the evil jade baloney
im not going to fight you
my rooftop dueling days are OVER
ugh
even if we just went balls out jackass BANANAS with our swords here i mean realistically how much appreciable advancement in my battle skills would even result from that
are you actually thinking this through or just going through the vaguely nefarious motions that come with the territory of being evildog!jade
yeah you probably will
youll probably annihilate me worse than my bro used to
dont you have all of your dogs insane powers and like
god tier space powers on top of all that
how exactly am i supposed to compete with that
no!
ok here i go
wait
nah
i told you
im not time traveling
i think im giving it up for good actually
_
249. GJ10: =008285
im serious
the thing is
being a time guy
like actually MASTERING time travel
im pretty sure what that involves is
learning to never use it
see its like karate
well
its more like what they SAY about karate
that you learn it so you dont use it
but i mean we all know the truth about karate is if you know karate then obviously in reality you use it all the time
like doing lethal fuckin crane kicks and sweet karate chops while walking down the street just cause you can
its a god damn no brainer thats what you do with karate
but see with time travel
all the stuff about learning it so you dont have to use it is true
theres no good that can come of it
you can crunch the logic on the loops all you want
but all youre doing is painting yourself into a corner
creating inevitabilities you have to rehearse and enact or face death for yourself or everyone you know
and sometimes facing death is the very inevitability you have to rehearse
and then you wait and wait knowing its coming and knowing it has to happen
how do you think it made me feel when we were gathering up all those frogs
and i knew the whole time in a little while you would have to watch me get shot
but i couldnt say anything or it would mess it all up
all cause i thought it would be cool to be marty mcfuckin fly
but instead of shredding johnny b goode on guitar to get my parents to bang
my crowning performance was doing a funny dance while getting pumped full of lead
then i had to leave everyone behind and get into the delorean and return to the 1980s
but the delorean was actually a big purple moon
and the 1980s was me accidentally reaching god tier and living on a shitty meteor for a while
and i guess rose was doc brown
doc brown accidentally reached god tier too
ok i guess this is where the analogy falls apart but you get what i mean
damn
ok lemme start over
why is that safe to expect
where are all these presumptions coming from
if you can use swords why dont you take the welsh cueball sword and fight him yourself
i bet you could fuck him up
youre probably even more extra strong now that youve succumbed to the bark side
did you ever think about that
the empress can suck it
i have no intention of fighting him
and this isnt even me pulling more lame self aware reluctant hero junk
i am just straight up not going to do it
see thats not reluctance its just petulant refusal on my part
reluctant hero shit is when the guys like aw shucks i dunno if i wanna but deep down we all know he really does
but i really dont
why should i
i dont give a damn about lord english or his nebulous atrocities out in nowherespace
what kind of villain is someone you never met who hardly did anything evil to you or your friends directly
or even to anyone in your universe for that matter other than through some vague insidious influence
who even is this guy and why should i hate him
am i really supposed to be pissed off at a green muscle monster i never met
cause i aint pissed off at no muscle monster
hell wasnt he in some ass backwards way responsible for us existing in the first place?
or all of humanity for that matter??
maybe i should thank him before chopping him up via welshscalibur
_
250. GJ11: =008286
what
why are you dragging that guy into this
what happened with you and him anyway
it kind of is
hes bird me
that clearly means i have a right to know
you said he had issues
what issues
was he talking shit about me the whole time or something
i know he resents me for being the real dave
man i knew it
i knew he was poisoning your view of me all those years
and i wasnt there to say anything or defend against his slander so now of course you think im a neurotic douche
yeah but i only started acting like a neurotic douche like half way through this conversation
you clearly had an axe to grind with me from the start and i want to know why
what did i ever do to deserve this shit from you
what
i did
when
whoa no way
thats such an unfair characterization we are completely different dudes
no i know
i was playing the "hes bird me" card because it was convenient to whatever it was i was saying at the time
i forget what point i was making when i said that
but thats not the point im making now
he and me are just
crazy different yo
hes got fuckin wings!!!
he also presumably takes a dump and lays eggs out of the same ghostly hole
...
ew man whyd i have to go there
ok if he broke up with you or whatever that was because of his dumb bird issues not my issues
theres no way i would have done that to you
my issues are totally different and probably way more serious
i dont see anyone ordering him to master time travel or trying to pawn brittle welsh swords off on him do you
nobody is telling him hes got to murder the incredible hulk
did you tell him hes got to murder the incredible hulk jade
no i think not

what are you doing
dont you dare touch the mayor

_
260. GJ15; JE30: =008304
john dont get me wrong its cool that you randomly dropped by again but this wasnt really the best time
we were kind of in the middle of a thing here
dude are you time traveling
please dont tell me youre time traveling
you need to leave that shit to the experts
who do you think youre talking to here
do you see this bright red gear on my hoodie
that means i know stuff about time travel
sure looks like youre time traveling to me
troll pirates
john youre fucking shit up here
you being here
thats not supposed to happen
all this shit were saying now
its not supposed to go down like this i can feel it
i dont think it matters now dude the pooch is already screwed
wow wait that was a terrible figure of speech in this context but you know what i mean
yo like i was JUST saying i didnt want to time travel anymore to avoid bullshit like this
then what is it
thats time travel genius
alright
but if it turns out you just created a doomed timeline and were all going to die im gonna be hella mad
huh
thats pretty dope if true
actually in a way that almost makes me more nervous
yeah messing with the alpha timeline
i mean not the alpha timeline but the ALPHA alpha timeline
almost seems
heretical i guess?
you sure you know what youre doing egbert
gotcha
welp im sold
but uh
really man you kind of are interrupting a thing
temporal mechanics not even withstanding
i think this was going to be a serious conversation here
i have a feeling jade and i were going to get all heavy with our relationship issues or whatever
uh
does anyone even know whats going on NOW?
truth
what??
holy shit so uncool
wow
jade i think you might be a little too good at being a villain its kind of worrying
so the mayor would be dead if john didnt show up?
god damn jade
why would you do that you know eventually id probably start using my powers and reluctantly start embracing my role as a reluctant hero
that shit always happens
yeah maybe
but the point is youre not going to bother killing the mayor anymore are you 
see john your fake time travel shit is already paying off
you saved the mayor congratulations
ok all yall settle down im getting a text

is it time yet
oh
how about now
i still dont understand whats supposed to happen
hes just supposed to like
appear?
you mean
here
on this frog circle thing
so jade came on a gold ship through a tiny window apparently
but john wasnt on it??
no its cool
you can have that thunder if you want it
_
285. KV42; VS2; ARSp1; TS1: =009358
(a what? dude lmao)
haha...ha
(um... yeah)
vris yo nobodys arguing with you on that everybody here thinks hes pretty cool
like just enough freakshow steps removed from being my bro i guess enough to make me not feel like-
(oh stfu)
_
286. TP45; VS3; KV43: =009360
so
am i inferring correctly from some shit i just heard
that uh
that vriska is like the de facto team leader now
or vriska and terezi...
i dunno i never understood the scourge shit
you two have always been like this scheming giggling enigma huddled together in peapod for hella self-tickled murderdorks
couldnt for the life of me figure out what youve been getting up to on that meteor
is this it
the plan you were hatching all along
is this like your big move
your power play to usurp karkat as team leader finally
oh got it
wait no dont got it
it sounds like youre just like
being the leader now cause you want to
and making all the plans because nobody else wants to or really cares
i mean not that i even care either i just want to set the record straight
karkat are you cool with this
karkat
karkat
karkat
yo karkat
oh my god
dude were you just not listening to any of that 
hahaha
man how long have you been tuning all this shit out
i mean i literally just said i dont give a fuck about any of the shit vriska is saying so maybe im not one to talk but at least i had the decency to actually be joking about that
what the fuck are you even doing
dude you dont have to get the go ahead from me
shoring up a lil one on one time with the mayor is literally always acceptable
what were you talking about
i didnt hear you mumbling anything though
no yeah i know what thats all about
how when you talk to the mayor and most of the time words arent even necessary like he just *knows*
man the mayor is just so wonderful i love him so much
hey lets all take turns hugging him
oh nothing really
just wondering how you felt about vriska usurping your leadership role
and if maybe you wanted to throw a vintage shitfit about that or...
ok so vintage shitfit it is
_
287. VS4: =009362
vriska
yo can we maybe bust out some refreshments while we wait for this totally imminent thing to transpire
can i take a look in the fridge
whats in the fridge
sorry i think i missed that part of the conversation
oh
yeah never mind
_
288. KV44; JE31: =009367
(wow)
(wow)
(hes really here isnt he)
(wow)
oh yeah hey john
whats up
_
289. JE32; KV45: =009383
hey bro
i guess thats the thing were all accepting as true yeah
i mean i wasnt going to but like not as a means of being an arbitrary dick to my number one childhood pal from the past
i have literally no first hand cognizance of ever being in danger i just fucked around on a meteor for a bunch of years
and here i am and so are you
which i think is pretty dope
karkat holy shit where are your manners
leaving a fist unbumped like that this is a new low
god damnit
here
_
290. KV46; JE33: =009384
strider to the rescue
the fist bump has been secured
wrecked
_
291. JE44: =009385
oh uh
yeah vriska had to knock them out
they were kickin up a ruckus
yeah we cant
some kind of brainwashing thing going on
gotta keep em napping
especially jade im sure you know what kind of crooked ass baloneyfuck powers she got
cant let her turn those against us
she should be pretty psyched to see you though
yeah
um
i dunno if you know this or not but
apparently along the way our version of john died
so she made the whole trip without you
yeah this timeline was gearing up to be pretty tragic i guess but then you sorta deus exxed out of nowhere and spared us those sadtimes
i mean from your point of view i guess it isnt deus ex shit you were just the normal john you always were all zipping around like a nerdy hypergod saving everything from whatever
but from our standpoint you just kinda yanked yourself out of random ass nothing but hey you know what ill take it
feel free but i have a feeling youll just be joining her nap if you try
dead
yeah
i guess so
its a weird subject for me
like
the guy was always on borrowed time wasnt he
i mean that was his whole "thing" right
yeah hes me and exactly what i would be like if i was a moping existential bird so its kind of embarrassing to even talk about ok
i guess it is """sad""" but you know a lot of versions of me have died
lots of versions of all of us including you
isnt whats important that certain dubiously categorized iterations of ourselves are all alive here and now and hanging out
dont stress over it
we still have some time to kill before shit starts getting real in this session
at least according to our vriska in chief
all the bad guys are still just outside the incipisphere
they wont converge here until a few hours or so
so lets all just sit back a while and shoot the shit
and i do mean empty our clips into the shit, like really pump that turd full of lead
right up until she gets bossy again and commandeers our fly brotimes with more shrill tactical exhortations
_
292. JE45; KV47: =009387
um
oh well let me tell you
vriska was most certainly alive during this one
like almost
extra-alive, if thats possible
ok dude maybe lets not spend our paltime trash talking serket if only cus theres no way youre not getting repeatedly trounced exactly just like that
dude
karkat what the fuck are you doing
ok its not an unreasonable conversation to have but like
we JUST started friend-jamming about past anecdotes to get us all up to speed or whatever
and youre already trucking out these guns
just sayin, it doesnt sound that casual and no big deal if you keep saying its casual and no big deal oh and also its the first fuckin thing out of your mouth to john in three years
yo im hardly one to talk here since i am a goddamn geyser of hilariously self-pulverizing freudian bloopers
at this point i cant even pretend to keep a lid on any shit ive got in me cause i know sooner or later during one of my rad soliloquies ill just pratfall butt backwards into an embarrassing admission and i just have to be like yeah... yeah ok thats my shit thats what im about lets just get the fuck on with our lives
so when johns like hey man and youre all locked and loaded with some stuff about how youre 'over him' and go on and on about it its like some way obvious protest-too-much shit and everybody knows it so i dont see how it salvages any of your dignity or whatever to pretend thats not whats happening
so what im saying is if youre so eager to push this out there-
if youre pushing this out there which you are then maybe we should rap about it
i mean discuss it critically and earnestly not drop ill rhymes or anything tho that could be sweet too
so are you SURE you still dont have these unreconciled blackrom feelings about john
i say we air this out before it ferments into some rank and hella unexamined feeling sauce
no!
i dont do that to bros thats huge uncool
i dont see what has to be uncomfy about chattin out our true ass thoughts and emotions
dude you clearly had a spades thing for john but i dont recall you ever bringing it up
is this something you been thinking about all this time or
yeah we coulda talked about this
i have all KINDS of shit to say about john seeing as he was my number 1 dude for approximately the majority of 13 years
the main dead end here man is like, nothing personal at all its just that he is literally incapable of hating anyone
gettin pissed off at a suspender dude sounds like just the sort of yarn i wanna be all ears for some time
but ok thats something to work with
hey karkat maybe theres some hope yet maybe its not a total lost cause
own
what
no way
im being real as a motherfucker
what part
john
dude i gotta say
when you talk about being or not being "a homosexual" you kinda sound like a corny old man
what does normal mean though
normal was some crap that ruled our dead civilization
we left that behind years ago
its all a huge pile of shit that doesnt matter anymore
im not sure i guess
ok i guess what im saying is
i dont think its all as simple as you think it is
or maybe not like ACTIVELY think it is but continue to assume it is on account of NOT thinkin about it much
due to a lot of junk about the subject that gets shoved into our brains from movies and stuff while we were just dumb kids
im just saying it probably isnt as absolute or simplistic as the way youve been framing it
or maybe it is for you personally i dont know
im just guessing you havent spent much time thinking about it if only cause all the stuff we read and watch suggests that like even examining your honest thoughts about it is perilous road to go down
cause if you actually think too much about it without always having that undercurrent of haha nope nope nope THEN what happens
what if it turns out youre like...
like not exactly the way you thought you were
or maybe not so much that, as old presumptions about what you were turn out to be not that relevant?
i dunno man
not sure what youve been doing the last 3 years all riding a large boat, then saving everyone from apocalyptic whatever
but ive had a fuck ton of time on my hands to think about stuff
about stuff ive said and done in the past why i said and did them
a lot of things i once would have insisted were like part of my brand and helped me come across cool and smartassy
but now im not so sure
we used rip on each other all the time for being gay even though we knew we werent which of course is what made it "funny" remember
yeah i know
it frankly IS funny to say how gay something is sometimes and lets face it sometimes someone or something is just flat out REALLY fucking gay and theres no two ways about it
its more like that through the preponderance of all that jokey shit is an underlying implication that its all lame stuff for pansies but not like us no were not lame and ha ha thats the joke
which thrives on this like double-buried implication that the REAL COOL SHIT is founded on this absurd wanky ideal about masculinity which if you think about it is 1. dumb as fuck 2. the male adulation of masculinity to that extent TO BE HONEST is pretty fucking gay unto itself and 3. was always some totally impossible shit for us to live up to anyway
i think all thats mixed up with the same phony ideals about heroism
like living up to the storybook idea of what a hero to me feels almost interchangeable with living up to societys snapshot of what a hard manly dude should be
i stopped pretending i could ever live up to either thing a while ago
and mainly have spent time looking back on the sheer magnitude of all my "joking around"
i used to lambaste fuckers left and right grinding them into the pavement over how gay they probably were and how much they were quite possibly jonesin to kiss some dudes or such
and i dont really feel bad about it in the sense that it was jerky or like "insensitive" necessarily even though i guess it maybe was
more that i feel like it was probably transparent
a massive front of outrageous snark to disguise a lot of insecurity
like a fuckin coverup
as long as i kept clowning hard about it i didnt actually have to think about it or face my actual beliefs
what no
man no look
dude you arent listening
although a gay butterfly effect is a pretty funny idea lets not dismiss that as a concept altogether
anyway maybe what im tryin to say is sorta getting lost in the weeds here
the fact that you were wondering if i "turned gay" makes me think maybe youre still not quite on the wavelength im tryin to ramble on here
maybe we should wrestle this topic to the ground another time, theres a lot more id wanna say but this is probably not the venue
i mean not literally wrestle to the ground because that is maybe literally the gayest course of action we could possibly take but you know what i mean
uh
_
293. JE46; KV48: =009389
yeah maybe we should drop this
i dunno if you ever picked this up from him but hes a pretty sensitive guy
its true
hes pretty much the easiest dude to rip on and makes for an irresistible target but you also have to know where to draw the line
really dont wanna actually you know like
upset him
man i dont know
thats just his regular shit
like, an every day occurrence but with different bodily positions and geographic configurations
bro will you get the fuck up here
k suit yourself
_
294. JE47; KV49: =009390
um anyway
as you can see ive been spending probably way too much time with trolls
it messes with you
gets you thinkin about... stuff
you know?
thats not too far off
its really inevitable
you pick up the lingo they pick up yours
its like a stupid cultural melange after a while that barely makes any sense from either frame of reference
they take all their quadrants pretty seriously tbh
yeah ive spent enough time talkin about it where i think i "get it" but
ive never had cause or any real inclination to put it into practice or anything
word
like who
me?
heheh
yuuup
whoa hes back!
all right side up and everything
i dunno john it all sounds pretty logical to me
karkat knows his shit when it comes to quadrants
it happens to the best of us sooner or later
this crap is kind of old hat to me by now but i get why youre kinda freckling at the implications here
you didnt have years of livin with trolls to kinda normalize this stuff
ok sounds like a weenie thing to do but sure have fun with that
dude that sentiment is well and good but
when youre pledging a vow of secrecy maybe you should try to keep it down a little
_
295. JE48; KV50: =009391
nah i disagree
both humans and trolls are emotionally versatile sentient beings that can feel many hells of different things
thats always a smart fallback position btw
especially on rap
i could school you on rap too are you confused about rap
so uh
this has been a hell of a reminiscence so far
seriously though i wasnt actually intending to fork this like instantaneously in the direction of some like
legitimately sincere dialogue on fuckin sexuality and romance
i didnt plan on this dude you gotta believe me
yeah
did we cover everything
whoa what
oh
right
yeah
so
howd that go
me and jade
or...
him and jade
hmm
yeah
_
296. JE49: =009392
hey
um
the girl you came with
roses mom
yeah
whats she like
yeah
how uh
how long have you and she actually been traveling together
huh
it sounds like you like her
no i mean
actually like her
wow dude after one day maybe you should slow your roll
im joking its fine who cares
shes my mom isnt she
why
is it
do you feel weird about dating my mom is that it
but if you did
then you wouldnt wanna think of her like that because of like the familial weirdtimes it invokes
ok
but
i think i like thinking of her as my mom
even if its a lil weird
not sure
i never even stopped and thought about it before
the idea of what it would be like to have a mom
instead of a hyper-aggressive lunatic of an adult male guardian
i never let myself give it a second of consideration
but now
seeing her actually here even though shes just some teen girl i never met
i like the idea
its nice
yeah
yeah i guess it kind of fucking is
sweet
_
297. RxLa1; RL75; KM13: =009396
hey what are we all talking about over here
_
298. RL76; KM14; RxLa2: =009402
in the middle of what
oh
i guess im in the middle of those now too
im feeling heartfelt as fuck somebody bone me up on the shit
come on
yes lots
um
yeah man kanaya to the rescue with smart shit to say as usual
ok but who cares about that
so rose
its our mom
hey mom
well not mom
your actual name instead of that i guess
roxy i think
i dunno that might be weird
calling you that all the time
rose would that be weird
so mom
im just going to jump right into the fuckin frying pan here
like tape off a no bullshit zone for a while
if thats ok 
captain Serious is at the pan and he got the go-ahead from lieutenant Doesnt Fuckaround of the Heartattack Armada
um i dont know maybe it is?
ok like its cool that you even know that fact but this is exactly the kind of fuckery the no bs zone doesnt cotton to no matter what sorta cookware is involved or which pseudomilitary organization regulates its borders
i just have some questions about you and about stuff in general so rather than mumble through a conversation that sounds mostly like the stuff we literally just got done sayin, sweet though that would be, im gonna machine gun some shit at you lighting round style
i know right?
so
you are my biological mother
and roses
and therefore bear at least partial and like biologically incidental responsibility for why we are both so fucked up
but you yourself are a paradox clone
which means
you didnt even have bio parents
you originated from yourself
so you really dont have anyone to blame for who you are except weirdly and paradoxically yourself
wait ok
sorry if that sounded rude i didnt mean it rudely
i mean
you did have a "parental figure" who you i guess modeled yourself after in a way
or were influenced by i mean
an old version of rose from a long time ago
and my bro was the same way
or
your friend i mean
he was a paradox clone of himself
and he like
did kind of the same thing
modeled himself after...
why dont we not talk about dirk
can we change the subject
i know
i know
look
i bring up a lot of things
and then have to back track a lot of those things i bring up
cause sometimes the things i bring up are ill advised to say or make people uncomfortable or make me uncomfortable
its just a thing about me
i guess so yeah
depends on if you want to keep sitting in this goddamn pan
maybe you should speak for yourself
SHIT
no mom look
roxy i mean
its like i was just saying
i just say things it is just like this force of nature no one can control or even try to, least of all me
we just have to cross our fingers and hope for the best
and that my one man verbal slapstick routine isnt too freudian in nature or at least not that often
anyway lets pretend i didnt just insinuate you have a hot ass and move on 
i heard something about wizards
you hells into wizards like rose?
ok well that is a predictable if somewhat bland fact
lets see if we can dig a lil deeper
dont get me wrong wizards are ok i guess
yeah, im alright
wizards are better at magic than me
but im better than wizards at rap
so i guess it breaks even
or it would if i was a pretend jackass in silly robes and a dumb beard
so point goes to dave
do you like rap
well what do you like to do
ok that is a fair opinion but cats arent actually an activity or anything
cat cloning huh
that sounds like a pretty dope hobby
i think were getting somewhere
so you had access to that kind of stuff becaused you lived in a scifi world
yeah the future
what was the future like
i see
and it was just the chess guys and you
like alone
no other people except for bro
who i guess was way off somewhere?
sounds like kind of a bummer
thats cool
me too
maybe when it comes down to it our lives werent that different
except for the extinction of humanity part
my humans were just
imminently extinct is all
i didnt have chess guys around though
theyre actually good company
my best best best best best friend is a chess guy
hes the mayor
ill have to introduce you to him soon
youll love the mayor everybody loves the mayor
dont worry ill put in a good word for you pretty sure we can find an opening in his schedule
tell me more
about you
fuck yeah
aside from cat breeding how else did you pass the time
haha seriously
like actual hacking
so kinda like john
except
i think he pretty much sucked at his codes
yeah
he seemed to find it frustrating mainly
his bitching about it is literally my only point of reference for his degree of proficiency
youre good though right
i bet youre good
knew it
fuck yes
hed be all about that
or i think he should be which is all that matters
do that and insist on it if he gets weirdly obstinate or like tries to pretend he doesnt like programming anymore
what else
you sure
what games
i see
which nintendos
that makes sense
thats mostly the relationship i have now with garbage romcoms
largely because karkat likes watchin em
so these godforsaken flicks have helped keep me grounded in our dead civilization in a weird way
but re: games...
i didnt have nintendos
my bro had xbox so i played that sometimes
but he mostly had all these shitty skating games
and like 20 different tony hawk titles
i would mainly just play them to fuck around
like find spectacular ways to crash and flop around like a douchey ragdoll
or figure out ways to get halfway stuck inside concrete fixtures and obstacles
and watch all these cool fratty bros twitch and flop ad infinitum
like struggling valiantly and earnestly forever against the shitty and deeply flawed physics of their confining virtual prison
i saw them as tragic figures
pretty much
oh my dick yes
what
thats fair
meh shes fine
yo thats been like
her EXACT top preoccupation since she was a fuckin baby
didnt she tell you
were all fucked up, the end
so what you wanna know mom
..rox
_
299. RxLa3; RL77: =009403
ok currently imagining that
hmm not bad
not bad at all
thats a dead tie
between me and snoop
also MAYBE obama but to be fair i dont think he raps irl that is mainly just a headcanon i have about him
but come on
you werent actually curious about that were you
rose and i went on a suicide mission piloting a moon through the furthest ring
the moon had a cosmic mega nuclear bomb in its core but also our quest beds by surprise
when it blew up it created literally the biggest fucking sun in existence which also happened to be the exact same sun we thought we were going out there to destroy
but we also died and resurrected as god tiers and i guess due to immortality rose up through the surface of the fuckin sun all glowing green and wearing pajamas and shit
why how did you do it
go on
no
eh that sounds alright
who even cares about having a baller origin story
we were just some chumps on a moon being melodramatic and in the process of gettin chumped by an omniscient creep
your outfit looks cool at least
what
man
these questions are taking on a different tenor than the ones i asked you
um yeah ok i WAS kissed
by jade when i was dead
so i would come back to life
that was like... RIGHT before the moon mission i mentioned
by who
maaan
hey i thought you were just "studying" us!
no come on
i just asked you about nintendo and shit!!
yes
yes
fuck yes
fuck fucking yes
like what
...
no
hell no
aj
apple juice
pretty much
god damn it!
_
300. RxLa4; RL78; VS5: =009404
i think the lightning rounds over
why dont we have a distraction to seal the deal
hey mom i think harleydad over there is talkin about you
i dont think hes noticing
nope hes completely out to lunch
just like all the harleyberts
thats it?
hes right back at it with the bull guy
whats with him
he reminds me a lot of john but really quiet which is very unjohnish
ill try gettin to know him some time
maybe trap him like a shy woodland creature
then brutally harangue him with my typically rad shit and become airtight bros
right there in the fucking woods
exactly how nature intended
awesome thanks mom
roxy i mean
nothing
its just like semi accidentally replacing a word with another word in a majority of instances
why do you need to read things into everything
exactly
see rose yall worrying about nothing as usual
moms fine with it
moxy
i mean
romy
mommy
wait fuck
ok that one was fucked up
lets make sure i never ever fucking say that again
i cant
its like i was saying before
this is a force of nature we all gotta just deal with
striders blurtscapades
daves flying boner circus
this shit is immutable
i had to face this fact a long time ago
i could either try to change that part of myself which is an unwinnable war
or i could try focusing on being like a vaguely half decent person so at least the shit i inevitably blurt out from deep down isnt all that bad
because the bad stuff has been and is still being purged through an arduous long term process of complete and utter humiliation
its fucked up that shes joking but also not even really
youll figure out how to crack her deadpan riddles theres an art to it
ok then that explains everything
if you got all the science genes then that means some scraped off on me
which would explain why my beats are so ill
its cause my science is off the charts
yeah i dunno
one of those things
whichever involved more dead shit
maybe
i sincerely mumbled about the idea once or twice sure
what about your quest
the shit with your planet and the rain and stuff
wasnt there still something to do there
yeah exactly
i did this really stilted like mashup of what i assume my "real quest" was
like involving breaking a sword and UNbreaking a sword and a fuckin BIRD was involved and then the bird unceremoniously DIED somewhere
it was kind of a mess
like me i guess so maybe that made sense
who knows what yours would have in store for you now
i mean
if you even wanted to bother
shrug
yeah i know why you feel that way
youve got big problems with authority
you always have and you probably wouldnt even put it that way cause it sounds really Teen of you and gauche or whatever
but its true
yeah here we go again right?
except just remember im a fraud at this stuff
except in this particular case im totally right
she sees this quest all neatly laid out for her wrapped in a bow
fuck it even looks like its made for little kids with like pink turtles and rainbows and shit
like here you go princess its babys first quest
almost like it was designed to piss her off
sburb says here, self improvement delineated and made comprehensible enjoy your cookie cutter odyssey
so because shes rose she goes no fuck my quest
literally starts wrecking shit
and maybe that itself was always her quest
oh awesome vriska was eavesdropping
what
_
301. RxLa5; RL79; JS1; RS1; VS6: =009405
um
what exactly the fuck
_
302. RS2; RxLa6; RL80; JS2: =009406
so
what does this even mean
theres two roses now like
what the fuck
what are we supposed to do with this information and unfolding set of circumstances
ok then
good to know im not dumb and this literally is inherently irrational
thanks ghost cat great job
so what now
_
303. RL81: =009407
rose
you ok
i mean
sure
i thought so too when bird dave happened
but that turned out to be like
a whole thing
and important stuff happened as a result... kinda
rose we dont have fuckin "arcs" we are just human beings
_
304. VS7; ARSp2; TP46: =009410
hey am i interrupting anything
ok i just thought i would
saunter over here
things are getting pretty lalonde heavy over there
two was ok or actually cool even but this
yeah
time to see whats up over here
how is it going there broquiusprite
ok that was some weird stuff to say
but cool
soooo
you are
some sort of freak right
ok good to know
its like
talking to someone who is half my bro...
but then not even really?
the bro half is half AI or something??
so maybe one quarter bro
but then maybe even less because like alt-universe considerations and also part sprite
yeah the bottom line is i can tell youre just a really watered down version
or maybe
sweated down
why the fuck are you so sweaty
oh god
you know
im kinda glad you sound this insane and for the most part barely understandable
it makes it extra obvious you arent my legit bro
which means i can actually talk to you while only being like vaguely confused and unsettled instead of curling up into a ball and having some sort of social conniption
speaking of which
uh
when is he supposed to get here btw
what do you mean
'expedited'
alright
so as long as im supposedly chillin and in no way wondering about my bro
are you SURE there are no beverages in that fridge
no aj or
maybe later
so youre sure theres nothin to drink in there
dunno why im so insistent
not like my fridge ever had anything comestible inside
why the fuck did you even bring it
oh come on
oh right
somehow i forgot that we literally just established that you had gamzee locked in there for some reason
you sure we shouldnt maybe
let him out
he could suffocate in there
hes not a fuckin god tier
hes faking it he just made that fuckin suit from scratch or something
i know hes complete trash but maybe we should just let him out
whats the harm its not like he can cause much trouble
we all way outnumber him and have way more powers and shit
_
305. VS8; ARSp3; TP47; RL82; RxLa7; JE50: =009412
so youre just gonna let him suffocate in there then
ok thats fair
i mean
firm
but fair
well maybe not that fair but i guess i dont care
so is johns hot mom awake yet?
i mean
not hot mom
just mom
damn
did anyone hear that
shit
lets reboot all trains of thought starting now
how much longer til his hot moms awake
mom
i mean his
not mine
his mom not my hot mom
my mom i mean
fucking hell
not my mom his
johns hot mom
JESUS
no vriska dont go
at least do me the solid of letting me land squarely on some phrases that allow some plausible deniability over whether i think johns mom is super fucking hot
shit wait
pretend i didnt say that while still rendering its meaning in your mind somehow
vriskas gone im not even talking to anyone
ok now youre just twisting my words around
ok thats an interesting thought but hear me out
what if
we ran an experiment and spent the rest of our lives finding out what happened if we never told him
what oh what the fuck
are you on the idiot drugs today
how could you possibly be serious about that
how is this unconscious teen grandmother not a completely smokin babe
no i dont even believe you
youre obviously just trying to rile me up by going against the grain of fragrantly obvious babefacts
no!
im not saying anything
just standard casual observations from a regular bystanding person
wow
wow
peddle LIES much?
i guess reprehensible dishonesty is all the rage with the troll kids today
no!
maybe
THANK you
for
defending the position i may or may not have been arguing for moments ago
NOPE
god DAMMIT terezi
_
306. VS9: =009418
so in addition for waiting for way too many jacks to get here
were also waiting for my bro too right
who... gets here at the same time or...
_
307. VS10: =009434
i guess thats me
_
308. VS11; TP48: =009435
there are all these rumors swirling around that ive gotta beat LE anyway
which is probably bogus but w/e
killing this guy at least would be the next best thing right
so maybe if i do that i could like
put the "prophecy" to rest
um
yeah sure
thats fine if uh
youre comfortable volunteering someone who isnt here for a deadly battle
its cool if you want to do that
...........
_
309. TP49; VS12: =009443
yeah
but
dunno
it feels weird to make some battleplans when one of our team members still isnt here
yeah you know im sure if teen hardass strider shows up with his sword and shades and shit and we say
hey dude look bad guy go kill
im sure the guy will be more than willing to oblige
its just
man
it feels wrong
planning "around" him
like hes a weird hypothetical battle mannequin
no!
its
its more complicated than that
and im supposed to...
be getting ready for this huge deadly battle which is SO much more intense than anything i ever did
even like 3 years ago back when i was actually doing adventure shit instead of watching dane cook movies
and somehow be all geared up for that
AND meet my teen bro for the first time
and say oh there you are thats cool
lets fight this random nigh indestructible asshole
and then
hug bump or something?
how do i deal with all this
i think i could end up getting us all killed and none of you are taking this seriously
??
what
what the fuck are you even going to do
_
310. JR1: =009559
...
_
311. DiSt2: =009573
so
that was pretty fucking weird huh
_
312. DiSt3: =009574
um sorta
but i guess she fused with her dead cat or something
the bottom line is we turned our back for two seconds and a shenanigan happened
pretty much business as usual
at least thats how it rolls for us idk about you guys here
yeah?
what happened
oh right
that guy
hmm
_
313. DiSt4: =009577
soooooo
so indeed
...
thats uh
our conjunction of choice it seems
(fuck)
_
314. DiSt5: =009578
yeah pretty much
its like
a whole story man
mostly involving vriska
if you knew her youd know thats all i had to say
youd be like ohhhh its a vriska thing ok got it forget i asked
she brought you here too actually
then jumped her ass in that window to go do whatever crazy bullshit she thinks needs gettin done
shrug
maybe
seems like it
kind of
karkat made some drawings so
i guess
ive got like
a sword and shit
yeah i know
mines not that good
its welsh
i mean
possibly fake welsh im not that sure
i know
for real?
fake japense
kinda like...
how all anime probably takes place in some kind of fake japanese universe?
thats cool
tough gettin a sword from a place like that
...
_
315. DiSt6: =009580
god i hope soon
_
316. DiSt7: =009634
what
yeah
well
one version of noir
theres a shitload of them though
hes yours
yeah
the one from your session
well i guess he broke out
hes kind of like a huge fucking deal now
i have no idea
i wasnt here
hes got lord english powers tho
hes apparently like
just
wretched fucking news
hes going to be hard to beat
even armed with the ultimate weapon:
some swords
i bet
what do you mean you didnt solve many problems
didnt you like
program robots and stuff
oh
those
_
317. DiSt8: =009635
yup
not according to my current understanding of a mostly nonsensical body of information
not sure
mostly that hes really hard to kill i think
he MIGHT be vulnerable to welsh things too
dont quote me on that
because
it will make me sound like an idiot
_
318. DiSt9: =009636
...
_
319. DiSt10: =009637
i already said i dont know
_
320. DiSt11: =009638
um
not soon enough is my best guess
and i guess
also my opinion?
_
321. DiSt12: =009641
sure
were you
you dont say
so
you think im an important part of your life
you dont actually know me though
not this me
and im pretty sure you didnt know the other guy either
what is it about me thats important then
why
idolized??
.........
_
322. DiSt13: =009642
i dunno if its "weird" i just cant process it
because
maybe not anything to do with YOU per se
but how i view my bro
and
ive got to say
meeting you
its not rockin my world here
or upending any paradigms or whatever
listening to you and looking at you
it really really just
reminds me of him
i know youre different and all and also like
a kid i guess??
but you dont feel that different
and hearing anything like that, like about idolization or like you were actually lookin forward to this in any sincere way
is kinda fuckin jarring
..................
_
323. DiSt14: =009643
well
heres well i guess
i didnt fuckin like you that much ok?
honestly i dont know if i want to get into it
_
324. DiSt15: =009648
ok actually maybe i will get into it
_
325. DiSt16: =009649
i dunno why my friends got to have adults around who cared about them
they complained bitterly about stuff so i guess i convinced myself they were all in the same boat as me
but thats not how it was
their complaints were trumped up nonsense and i bought it cause... i dunno
i didnt have any frame of reference
but his dad and her mom no matter what they said it was so obvious they cared about them deeply
even jades weird fuckin grandpa who died when she was young obviously would have done anything for her
why did i get such a raw cut of the asshole deck
and why did it take me so long to figure that out
and like hes dead now so thats that
so all thats left to do is look back and try to put the pieces together of my first 13 years
and all i can think is what the fuck WAS that?!
i dont come away with the impression i used to try convincing myself of, that he was like "mysterious" or "stern" or "aloof"
the only feeling left is this insane impression that i was raised by somebody who fuckin HATED me
and the whole act of even "raising a child" was some totally fucked up game to him
like parenthood was one of the highest tiers of irony in his solemn bullshit bro-ninja code
so he went through those motions and did whatever he thought was "funny" or "badass"
but under that weird stylistic and totally sociopathic approach to parenting i cant even IMAGINE there was any emotion toward me other than some sort of loathing
i dont want to get out the laundry list
but for reference laundry wasnt one of those things
that was just one of the many little domestic things i just had to sort of FIGURE OUT
sorta like i eventually had to learn what the REAL purpose of a refridgerator was from movies
i dunno theres too much to even get into
just
i dont remember the atmosphere ever not being nerve wracking
all havin to sneak around and...
ugh my shitty childhood spider senses are tinglin just thinking about it
it was "training" you know
but you know what it really was it was some vicious shit that was bad and sucked and i hated it
it didnt make me stronger
it did the opposite
it made me never want to fight
it made me never want to see blood or be near danger or hear metal sounds
it made me hate the idea of being a hero cause he was a hero and he ruined the idea of heroism
i dont even want to be fighting this shitty version of jack but hey nobody else has secret welsh powers so i guess i have to
what gets me is how long it took me to put all this together
to stop seeing it as some kinda roughhousey and eccentric life i had but was otherwise normal
it took years to deconstruct it all and put it back together to understand how fuckin mad i should be
and in particular how stone cold deeply uncared for i was my whole life
like... being merely "monitored" by a violent robot
i only started getting it after spending a lot of time in person with a bunch of people who actually did care about me
and i could start feeling like
actually somewhat human for the first time
instead of...
some sort of runty afterthought to a household cabal of smutty puppets
the fuckin puppets!!!
i know how it sounds but i am NOT joking and there is NO shred of doubt in my mind that he loved all those puppets more than me
honestly it is very possible that he was just insane and thats that
i guess it didnt help either that we lived with what we have come to understand may theoretically be the most evil doll to exist in any universe ever
in fact its my tenuous understanding that he came down to earth with that thing and like actually grew up with it
maybe...
maybe spending 30 some years being unseparable from that hell puppet had some effect on him??
maybe if it hadnt been casting a pall over our apartment 24/7 since he took me in...
grinning...
glaring...
laughing in my sleep...
maybe our lives wouldnt have been quite so...
maybe we would have...
ugh
_
326. DiSt17: =009650
.....
.....
yeah
yeah
huh
how do you know that
well
whatever his was
"empty" is never how i would have described it
man
i dunno if i figured something out here
like um "explained" something or
if im just driving myself crazy with this talk and nothing even needs explaining
it doesnt change my past or how i feel about him
he was still pretty much awful no matter what the reason
and im sure thats the only feeling ill ever have about him
so who cares why it was like that
_
327. DiSt18: =009651
come on man
YOU didnt do anything
this was just some douche bag with your exact dna, who happened to grow up to be my bro
you had a completely different life full of like
different choices and actions and stuff
and even if you were gonna turn out like him youve barely cleared the half way mark on actually chronologically gettin there
in some way ranting about all this is probably just uncool of me because...
you arent him
youre not resposible for any of this shit but im sorta implicitly tacking it on you anyway
so
sorry about that
what way
splinters...?
right
pretty much dick squat
...
_
328. DiSt19: =009652
thanks
but
it still feels a little odd accepting an apology from somebody who i just met and technically had nothing to do with my life
even if you do feel guilty splinterways or whatever
it is just a messed up situation
and i guess i had to vent
and there was never anyone i wanted to say all that to
and the only thing that was gonna drag it out of me i guess was like a teen stand-in phantom of my dead bro
just some perfectly innocent dude havin to take the brunt of this shit
what happened there
yeah
i mean
maybe its a little different cause relations between peers is a whole other thing
its tricky shit and youre both figuring stuff out on a relatively equal footing and youre both at the same point in your lives
its not like when one person is older and supposed to be a lot more...
never mind this is a fucked up thing to think about
but the bottom line is yeah laying low while you sort out your stuff cant hurt
you dont actually seem like a bad person to me though
nah
because
i dunno if truly bad people wrestle so much with whether theyre good or bad
i think if i ever sensed my bro like
struggled at all with what he was doing or who he was
or showed any sort of doubt
that might have changed everything
but there was never a crack in it
or the slightest hint of introspection behind the aggressive cooldude facade
if there was i sure never noticed
i mean personally
i think about it all the time now
what it actually means to be good or bad
or if not something that starkly moral
at least just trying to examine the difference between being decent and being a douche
maybe its because of him i worry about that now
but for me i think that internal struggle is kind of mild
for him...
or you i mean
it sounds like some pretty dark shit
like grappling with...
becoming evil vs simply trying not to
but the point is
even just talkin to you a little bit
its obvious youve been fighting with that
which means that you care enough to put in some effort
i think that counts for something
_
329. DiSt20: =009653
well when it comes to the subject of him
the bars already pretty low dude
so
was that stuff true
when you said you idolized the other version of me
and not just some bullshit like how i used to say the same thing about my bro when i didnt know any better
_
330. DiSt21: =009654
you say there was a lot to admire
like what
holy shit
that
yeah
ima need to hear more details on this some time
yeah
but then for all my bitching i guess i still never grasped your full reality
just like you probably didnt grasp mine, but just reading into the mindset of a historical figure as best you could
what if i wasnt as heroic as it seemed?
what if adult me was kinda douchey too in a way you couldnt observe
_
331. DiSt22: =009655
...
you
...
...
...
you dont think im cool?
...
...
yeah
i
_
332. DiSt23: =009656
ill have to think
_
333. DiSt24: =009661
hey
sorry about this
_
334. DiSt25: =009662
for what im doing now
this bullshit right here
its
_
335. DiSt26: =009663
its really fucked up of me
what im presently doing
so
sorry about that
i know
_
336. DiSt27: =009664
so fucked up
_
337. DiSt28: =009665
sorry
_
338. DiSt29: =009817
damn
and i thought our houses were pointlessly tall before
it just doesnt stop from keep constantly getting more and more vertically enormous
haha yeah
we made sure as fuck not to come right out and literally describe that building as tall
we are way on the same page philosophically here
sounds like a club for losers to me
theyre lucky they dont have any members, otherwise theyd all be lame as hell
so uh
why do the houses need to be so tall again
i never actually understood that
except to reach the gates but once we all figured out how to fly and shit that became so pointless
oh
how do you know this
do you guys have like a manual or
so youre in communication with him like...
RIGHT now?
right
and
uh
why... did you make that thing again
not that you ever told me before
'again' is just like a stammering tack-on to that sentence so as to try and not sound too fucking rude
so you just
straight up programmed a copy of your brain
yeah me too
i mean, about my interests and stuff
hmm
i guess i started some projects i regretted
but nothin like making a milk weirdo eventually exist
it sounds fucked up but is also kind of an awesome story in its own way 
maybe im lucky i was never that good with computers
now computer ART thats a different story
ok it actually isnt i fuckin suck at that too
but dammit i try my best and make some magic happen at least in my own mind so maybe thats good enough
yeah
i mean
i DID captchalogue my own ghost brain once but i didnt know what to make of that and thought it was kinda weird so that never really went anywhere
probably for the best
for real
my bro did cool things with computers too
i mean nothin like making a clone of his brain or anything thank god
just some absurd bullshit with web bots and stuff mostly to help prop up his various "enterprises"
yeah
but with puppets of course
it was always about the puppets
he made all these porn bots that would just talk to each other in a chatroom endlessly
all like gettin each other riled up about squishy bottoms and whatnot
actually it was pretty entertaining to watch them go at it for hours
i think they may have been teetering on the threshold of SOMETHING resembling self awareness?
except they only seemed to apply that faculty to reach even more heightened states of sexual excitement for a bunch of nude soft puppets
yeah you know he did some cool things
it wasnt necessarily all inherently terrible
things i would really appreciate under better circumstances
he definitely had a lot of drive and also some uh "ideas" that warranted a certain amount of respect i guess
he just
maybe should not have been allowed near a child?
sall im sayin
_
339. DiSt30: =009818
nah im alright
i think that is all mostly out of my system
i mean not forever because i dont think thats how things work
i just mean my venting fit is over and im probably good for another 16 years or so and i can return to being mostly deadpan and rad
sure
assuming we havent been killed by like 10 jacks before that i will
you certainly seem to be the right guy for that
i mean like the most suitable recipient of my hysterical fits on that particular subject
there is no way i would ever tell karkat all that
i mean maybe some stuff but not ALL the stuff its just too heavy
i certainly wasnt gonna mention the stuff to rose or john or jade or whoever else
if i was ever gonna do one of my patented acrobatic pirouettes off that particular handle to anyone it really only could have been at him
except he was dead
and even if he wasnt and i did say all that shit
theres no way it would have resulted in anything resembling reconciliation
which i think
was something i kinda needed
but didnt realize it
so....
thank you for being a really plausible stand in for him who i could rip to shreds??
while still being basically innocent of all that terrible garbage
so you end up sorta being like an avatar for him that is much easier to forgive
i mean
maybe FORGIVE isnt the right word because im not sure he deserves that and anyway it doesnt matter because hes been dead for years and at this point is just an irrelevant deceased weirdo who doesnt matter anymore
i guess i mean coming around to a place where i dont have to feel rotten all the time anymore
and i guess im lucky i got to blunder into a reality that just happened to have the exact right version of a dude which made that possible for me
sorry this fuckin ramble is really getting away from me
i have no idea if im making sense anymore
hey can that be like
the motto on our family crest
_
340. DiSt31: =009819
_
341. DiSt32: =009819
all that melodramatic sadbabble aside
i think its perfectly cool if youre still curious about your adult self
and i dont mind tellin you more stuff about him if you want
i know im still wondering about what my adult self got up to
kay how about
we do this thing
when i met roxy we did a thing
yeah
its called the lightning round
well yeah when she does it
we could be chill though
when it comes to asking about each others secret crushes and shit
it is settled then on the fact that we are a couple of cool dudes who know where to draw the line on certain topics
it can be yours go ahead shoot
i was a baby and i came down to earth on a meteor while riding a pony with a pink heart on its ass
he found me in a crater on top of a dead pony and gave me a lil baby pair of shades that look exactly like the ones youre wearin now
yeah
years ago john got me these for my bday
it might have been like an "ironic dare" to wear them i dont remember
but when i got em i was like hell yeah im wearing these
gonna rock these fuckers til the end of time
they were ben stillers
like literally
they actually touched his weird sort of gaunt face in one of his films
yeah
wait what happened to him
dunno ask roxy
but yeah we would send each other stuff sometimes
me and john
well we all would
usually absurd birthday packages and such
nice
one time it turned out we ACCIDENTALLY sent presents through time
i mean not literally, more in a roundabout way
we all sent john a rabbit
but all three rabbits just turned out to be the same damn rabbit
because of stupid time shit
wow
yeah i dunno what happened to johns rabbits either
rabbits am i right
what next
yep
i think so
that was a long time ago
kinda weird to imagine him strutting around with that puppet as a kid in the 80s
or maybe just kinda funny actually
he sure held on to it a long time
must have gotten attached at a really early age and just never let go
i guess you fell to earth with one of those things too?
hmm wait we fucked up
i asked you a question its not my turn
keep firing
he died fighting one of these jacks
at this point i almost forget which one
no wait
ok yeah it was the omnipotent dog one
the jack from our session
he was fighting like a lesser form of him and then jack got extra prototyped by dog powers and then got outmatched and stabbed with his own sword
pretty sure davesprite was fighting with him and almost died too but then it turned out he didnt
but now im at least 99% sure that davesprite is DEFINITELY dead and wont suddenly reappear as a stupid surprise or anything
word
seems that way
not sure what he knew or how he knew it
all our guardians seemed to know bits and pieces of stuff and did vague mysterious things to prepare
to this day i have no idea if he was training me to fight lord english or if he even knew who that guy was on any conscious level
or it was more like general purpose training to be able to survive some hard shit after the end of the world happened
youd have to ask him but thats impossible
i do know he managed to get the drop on a meteor before i entered the game
as far as i can tell he stood on top of it and split it in half with his sword
yeah it does doesnt it
but then again so does a baby getting dunked from space in the ocean then floating on a weird doll and then growin up by himself with no adults around
_
342. DiSt33: =009820
yeah ok
questions about me hmm lets see
ok FIRST the fuck of all
what happened to ben stiller
wow
did my adult self get pissed about stiller
i bet he got pissed
what the fuck
how fucking dare that woman
so then he tried to kill the batterwitch right
who is the same exact alien as the condesce in this session??
so...
does john know that he is literally about to go fight betty crocker yet or what
nah
i mean not to my or his knowledge
he just fuckin hated that company for some reason
i think his reason was literally as mundane as just being slightly overexposed to cake
thats classic john though he doesnt get pissed about anything except for the absolute dumbest shit
but i guess his instincts were right in this case
maybe we should just
not tell him
that hes fightin crocker i think the poor dude has probably had enough mental breakdowns for one adventure
we all have
yeah
well i guess we could have hung out there a few minutes longer
i mean you wouldnt have got much outta jade who is stuck in perma-nap mode
just like old times i guess
she used to sleep a lot
but yeah there wasnt much time except for like a bunch of heys and oh nice to meet yous
and also i think i would have still been a shitty train wreck socially if we all just hunkered down right then and there for another extensive round of freestyle paltalk
i guess jake was kinda like your john of the group huh
wait that was a pretty dumb observation never mind
john and i never really had anything like a falling out
except for not talkin to each other for a few years on account of being on a meteor and boat respectively
but i guess you two had some buddy troubles or somethin?
what happened
wait
you
you dated jake?
...
so
you
...
hmm
nothing
i think were breakin on of the rules here
this tangent got too personal
_
343. DiSt34: =009821
yeah
so that covers how he died
taking a futile stand against some unbeatable foe
cant say im too surprised about that cause what else is even new
what about his early life though
guess i arrived around the same year my bro did in my universe?
just came down on the same dead horse i rode in on
into a world full of opportunities
how did i get started
i guess the one thing we know for sure is i didnt find a kid in a crater and take him under my wing
that was probably for the best
actually maybe its better that most of his story is left to my imagination
kinda like how you said you spent a lot of time thinkin about him
filling in the gaps of his ridiculous exploits
like what
actually wait
dont tell me
at least not now maybe down the road it would be cool to hear some
i think id prefer to fill in the blanks myself for a while
really it sounds dope as hell to imagine that sort of blank canvas life
dropped on earth as a kid in the 70s or 80s or whatever with no bossy adult to reel me in
and just having to figure stuff out
especially knowing that many years later it all worked out ok
really wonder what i did
was i like some homeless eighties ragamuffin???
jesus christ that sounds fairly adorable if so
maybe i slept in an alley on a bed of rubix cubes and alf merchandise
or maybe i offered my old school rap services for food
yes exactly
this sounds like exactly the life for me
what if without a penny to my name and the wind at my back i hopped a boxcar to the big apple
because as a dumb child i naively believed thats where they made all the apple juice
id be sorely disappointed when i got there but it wouldnt matter because id probably scrape together a living on off off off broadway like...
making shitty cartoons
on stage
and saying
you guys
this will be SO much funnier once the internet happens TRUST ME
then the aristocratic patrons of fine theater just shrug and dump their shillings into my orphan hat
hahaha
_
344. DiSt35: =009822
i wonder if he had like
friends
sure
i mean im sure he knew rose at some point because obviously they teamed up
but as fairly old people?
it sounds as though they only knew each other as a result of their notability
i mean more like the friends i grew up with
he couldnt have grown up with john or jade as friends because they were already old by the time he got there
this cool 80s kid fantasy was probably just a lot lonelier than ive been picturing in my sweet daydreams
i didnt even have the MAYOR god what a nightmare now that i think about it
i wonder if all he cared about was making ludicrous shit and fighting evil pastry moguls
do you know if he had any other interests
i dont know
did you ever read any urban legends about.....
paleontology
yes the scientific study of dead shit
hmm
i guess he probably didnt do anything with that
what a shame
maybe he never even got the idea since he had completely different experiences
but if i were suddenly dropped back in the 20th century id probably look into it at some point
i dunno how though
i think it would be mainly like
some sort of theraputic interest
something relaxing to think about instead of a bunch of ironic and stupidly ambitious objectives
yeah exactly
sounds like the fucking life to me
dunno
maybe were tapering off with the lightning round stuff anyway and its just naturally deteriorating into regular dudechat
k heres a curveball
what the fuck are you wearing
huh
gotta say
some of these god tier ensembles really are...
something
i thought the same thing about my cape outfit at first
felt like some bozo from the renaissance festival
like maybe i should get on a horse and sing a shitty ballad
but then it grew on me pretty quickly
hardly ever took it off in three years
youre right its comfortable and theyre fuckin magic pajamas or whatever and they start to feel like part of who you are after long enough
i mean they are supposed to last you forever right
kinda by definition since they come along with immortality
maybe part of their magical nature includes this insidious quality where they grow on you
or not i dunno maybe this is bullshit and ill just wear some normal person clothes when this is all over
what about you are you gonna wear god duds forever
im cool with deeming it as such
yeah maybe youre right and we should all stop dressing like tools from an infinite magic slumber party for floundering teens
and just look like standard floundering teens
some of the getups are pretty out there
jakes tho...
uh
damn??
yeah there was uh
some palpable awkwardness there
sorry im still
tryin to
like
wrap my head around
...
uh
dammit
ok i guess i might have to break one of our lightning round rules
only a little tho
i hope
yeah
ok maybe im not even asking you anything
maybe this is just a starting point to ramble to myself
on a certain topic
i think...
there is a SLIGHT chance...
i may be the biggest idiot in the world 
when it comes to understanding some things about my bro
some pieces i never really put together
about him
until maybe literally right now
which i think makes me an objective dumbass
idk
nothin
maybe i dont wanna ask you anything about jake
maybe ill just keep abiding by the code of basic dude manners on that
if i bother skirtin the line of this rule maybe id rather ask you other stuff instead
like
um
say one of your best friends is a knucklehead you havent seen in three years
and unless you use ultra direct and explicit language he just wont put two and two together himself
and also say ANOTHER best friend is a girl you feel like you had kind of a special relationship with but you ALSO hadnt seen in three years
and shes asleep
but at some point shell wake up and youll have to talk to her
this is dumb im not making any sense
lemme start over
