Act 1
_
1. DS1: =001926
i got a little monsters poster, it's so awesome. i'm going to watch it again today, the applejuice scene was so funny. 
ok thats fine, but i just have one question and then a word of caution. have you ever seen a movie called little monsters starring howie mandel and fred savage? 
all im saying is don't you think monster howie mandel has the power to do something as simple as reseal a bottle?
try using your brain numbnuts.
it was the 15th day in a row howie mandel peed in his juice. 
no.
did you?
game bro is a joke and we both know it. 
alright.
_
2. DS2: =001935
yes, it is understandable because you are really attractive. i am attracted to you. 
jk haha.
no, i don't have it yet.
my dad has the mail and i guess i have to go get it from him and see if it's there.
and i've been busy spending all afternoon shitting around with my stupid sylladex.
it's so frustrating.
what?
oh. like one at a time i guess. and if i put too much in, something falls out. 
what is yours?
what the hell is that?
i guess.
no.
well, i've got a hammer but it's trapped under some arms. 
how?
_
3. DS3:  =001939
ok, i did it.
yeah.
uh...
yeah, that's fine i guess. i can't imagine it's going to be all that relevant.
_
4. RL1: =001963
that's an ugly rumor.
whoever told you that is a filthy liar.
and you should probably stop hitting on him all the time or whatever.
anyway i still haven't checked the mail, my dad has it.
i'm trying to go get it from him, so brb
what?
no, why would you even think that??
that's so stupid.
alright, wish me luck.
oh, btw...
jk I was wearing a funny disguise this whole time.
gotcha! hehehehe
_
5. DS4: =002010
i discovered a comet that is going to destroy the earth, and it was named after me.
now i am famous, and everyone wants to talk to me a lot.
mcconaughey.
those are my dad's.
oh, what?! no way man, nick cage is sweet. so sweet.
i do things ironically sometimes.
what about what i sent you for your birthday?
what? no, they're stupid, which was the joke. the IRONIC joke. get it?
wait...
you're actually wearing them, aren't you?
you do realize they touched stiller's weird, sort of gaunt face at some point. 
yeah.
yeah, there's a big red one.
i would, but it's trapped under the sburb beta, so i will probably open it after i install the beta.
yeah! wanna play it?
why not!
where'd she go.
ok, i will.
_
6. RL2: =002035
whoa ok but i just got the most awesome present. 
SO SWEET.
ha ha, what?
oh the game, ok.
i don't really know how this works. what am i even looking at here? 
oh, ok then.
_
7. RL3: =002041
whoa, what are you doing??
is my magic chest on the roof now??
: (
_
8. RL4: =002044
hey, do you think you could do me a favor?
can you grab all that stuff outside my broken window and bring it in for me?
thx!
:C
_
9. RL5: =002053
wow, ok.
what do they do.
how do i move stuff around? it sounds fun!
what??
no!
oh man.
i think i might know where it is.
_
10. RL6: =002054
good idea!
ugh, i was fussing with my retarded sylladex.
but i think i have it under control now.
what modus do you use?
oh no, that sounds so awkward.
_
11. RL7: =002057
why is the floor shaking?
are you dropping more stuff in my house?
sweet!
what is with all these big contraptions?
huh.
to what end?
i mean what are we supposed to be doing in this game?
_
12. RL8: =002060
hey, i'm out on the balcony now.
i am messaging from my dad's pda.
no, i am telling you.
it jumped out of my sylladex like a frightened weasel.
what? no.
those were all accidents.
please take your psycho-babblery elsewhere, miss!
oh man, see this isn't cool.
all this snooping nonsense!
yes. there is.
ok, if that will satisfy your weird ocd complex then go ahead.
in your case, probably!
anyway...
i am going to have a look at this enormous platformy thing you put on the balcony.
_
13. RL9: =002063
whoops what?
_
14. RL10: =002064
what was that noise?
is this something i should go investigate?
_
15. RL11: =002065
augh!
the what?
_
16. JH1: =002069
oh hey!
no, not yet.
oh!
yes, but it is in my dad's car and he is still out at the store.
he should be back soon.
i am up to my neck in this sburb stuff.
TT is making a royal mess of my house.
oh, it is this game.
it's ok i guess. i'm still figuring it out.
what was what?
wow, really?
oh man, alright but be careful, ok?
_
17. RL12: =002070
oh hell no, you put this thing in front of the door? 
um, YEAH???
you mean you thought it was elegant?
ok well what do i do with this thing.
hello?
what are you doing up there now?
_
18. RL13: =002074
you can see me, right.
tell me what is wrong with this picture.
hah, yeah i hear you.
i know!
what about going outside?
maybe you could catch a neighbor's signal.
It's dark already?
haha, um, ok.
_
19. RL14: =002078
what is this thing?
and what is that clock counting down to?
ok.
weird.
well, i mean it is a new game.
_
20. RL15: =002084
this thing keeps following me around.
i think it's trying to talk to me or something.
hmm, ok.
well, you are the one with the cursor so just do whatever you think is the right thing to do!
also, fix my bathroom.
_
21. RL16: =002087
i still can't understand this thing's gobbledygook.
the clock is ticking.
we don't have time for this asinine tomfoolery.
extravagant hogwash!
ok stop
stop typing whatever silly thing you're typing.
i'm going upstairs to the big platformy thing.
??
_
22. RL17 + DS5: =002104
RL - oh man who cares about the bathroom, now there's a meteor heading for my house!!!
i don't know, maybe! what do i do!
wow, FASCINATING.
??????
ok i'll do that.
DS - oh man, the bunny was awesome, but i don't have time to talk, i'm playing sburb and it's kind of a nightmare.
TT is breaking everything in my house.
and now there's a meteor coming, and i'm not even joking about that!!!
it's like a big asteroid or comet or something.
in the sky.
heading right for my house!!!!!!!!
i dunno.
big, i guess.
i gotta go!
we'll talk later if i am still alive and the earth isn't blown up.
_
23. RL18: =002111
alright, i used the lathe to make this blue shapey thing.
now i guess i take it back to the alchemixer again?
hello???????
uh...
_
24. RL19: =002140
hurry up and open my door!!!!!!
not that it even matters, i think i'm probably dead no matter what!!!!!!
???
so what is it, like an apple or something?
what good will that even do?
do we have enough of those building jewels to make it?
_
Act 2
_
25. RL20: =002156
hey, yeah i'm here!
and not dead i think.
oh man, sorry, i was looking around for my dad and i can't find him anywhere!
have you seen him?
yeah, like where am i?
wow, ok.
so then i guess if this is all the game's doing, then the point is for us to save the world?
then we'd better get moving and figure this game out!!!
ok.
wait, rose! one thing...
you never even wished me a happy birthday!
um... hello?
haha, oh jeez, that is silly!
anyway, thanks!
_
26. RL21: =002168
i'm fine i guess.
since i got here i feel compelled to do these weird things i don't really want to do.
by some kind of voice that i can't really even hear. i don't know, it is hard to explain.
yeah, maybe. who knows!
Ok. I will go back inside.
_
27. RL22: =002175
what? oh man, you're going to use that?
that sucks, what a stupid idea!
but the cake mix... ugh, that's so dumb.
fine.
i GUESS.
_
28. RL23: =002178
OH YES, SWEET!!
now we're talking!
_
29. RL24: =002183
aw man, where'd it go?
what, there's a fire??
oh jeez!
so move this thing already!
how much do you have?
oh.
hmm.
i thought about jumping to the car from the ledge earlier but that sounds really dangerous!
_
30. DS6: =002187
dude, i don't have time for your nerdy raps!
it sounds like you don't even believe me that i was about to get blown up!
but i really was, but now im in some weird dimension that sburb sent me to or something.
and now on top of that i think i'm being haunted by my dead grandma!
yeah, it's true but i'll talk to you later about it!
 man, see i just don't think all the rapping stuff is really as cool as you think it is.
no, i have to go! bye!
_
31. RL25: =002189
whoa, ok.
but the door is locked!
but it's my dad's car. :(
alright.
_
32. JH2: =002193
oh hi!
was it by any chance a meteor?
oh man, it's kind of a long story!
anyway, are you ok? did it blow up your yard or start a fire or anything?
well gosh, he's probably right!
er...
yeah, i was trying to get it, but rose dropped my car into a weird spooky bottomless pit and the package was in the car and im really sorry about that.
wow, ok, i guess i should start at the beginning.
see, a meteor blew up my neighborhood.
but i'm ok! and my house is too, sort of.
that game i was telling you about, sburb which i was playing with rose, sort of transported me somewhere at the last minute.
but now i'm trapped here and it's weird and dark and i can't find my dad and i just lost the car and my copy of the game in the pit and i think i have to save the world from the apocalypse!!! 
wow, you think so?
well ok, BUT.
it's not even that simple!
i was about to connect to rose to help transport her and save her from meteors and fire and stuff.
but she lost battery power and i lost the game disc!
so i think i have to get TG to use his copy to save her!
but that jackass won't shut up and stop rapping and stuff.
yeah. anyway i should talk to him about it, so brb.
_
33. DS7: =002194
aaaaaarrrgh!
stop rapping for a second you horse's ass!
i have something important to talk about.
rose is in trouble and she needs help. i was going to connect to her with sburb but i lost my copy!
also she lost battery power. if she can get back up and running, she'll need someone with the game to get her out of there before her house burns down.
so i think you should use your copy of the game to help her!
why?
i thought you said you had two?
well get his then!
whatever.
also you might want to read rose's walkthrough to get up to speed on this.
what?

COPY OF CONVERSATION DS1. =001926
_
35. DS9: =002286
oh, good!
yeah, there is no sign of rose yet, i hope she is ok
you mean that cheap piece of shit you have on your wall?
ok i don't really care.
i'm in my room again, i really think there's someone else in this house.
like monsters or something.
haha I WISH.
maybe. yeah you're right.
ok ok stop!
what do i do?
hmm...
ok, i guess i can read up on data structures some more.
how's it going there?
hahaha.
oh god.
SO LAME.
see...
i just don't know why you think it's cool.
his ventriloquist rapping thing.
that's fine, you are entitled to your opinion, i am just saying that being a white guy who is a rapper with a ventriloquist doll is not cool by any stretch of the imagination or by any definition of word cool, ironic or otherwise. that's all i'm saying.
yeah, more like the opposite of all those things is the thing that is true!
i'm going to read.
good luck with your bro.
_
36. NS1: =002320
um... nanna?
wow, you scared the living daylights out of me!
well, i guess it was a really great prank. good one nanna.
anyway, are you REALLY my dead nanna?
ok, i guess i will take your word for it. i don't remember you at all! my dad said i was really young when you died.
hey speaking of which, do you know where he is??? i looked everywhere for him!
_
37. NS2: =002321
oh no!
what? ok, so what is the medium you are talking about?
you mean because we are inside a computer, or in the game software or something?
well, uh, it's like this machine that, uh...
oh, ok.
i'm not sure i get it, but alright.
so what do i actually need to be doing here?
_
38. NS3: =002324
ME??
_
39. NS4: =002325
wow, really? then what's the point?
whoa!!!
how i am supposed to get up there?
_
40. NS5: =002326
ok, i think i get it now!
so i guess the battle against good and evil is sort of irrelevant? well, i don't know, that all sounds kind of weird, but in any case, we build the house to get to these gates, and then i can save my dad!
and then after that, we solve this ultimate riddle thing and save earth from destruction!!!
_
41. NS6: =002327
oh...
and that is?
_
42. NS7: =002328
thanks, nanna.
hooray!
...
_
43. RL26: =002373
so i can see.
stupid lousy imps.
they're mucking up all my cool stuff!
oh, yeah.
sorry!
i'm not sure what came over me there, i was acting really crazy for some reason.
but my head feels like it's clearing up, i think i'm alright now.
_
44. RL27: =002378
rose my piano!!!
:C
i guess you're right.
so...
that means i have to go out the back door?
well it may sound dumb, but i was hoping to avoid nanna and her spooky ghost cookies.
can you see her in the kitchen?
what's she doing, is she baking?
are you SURE you can't get that grist up to me somehow?
_
45. RL28: =002382
on what?
_
46. RL29: =002384
oh yeah. ok.
blargh!
well, what are you building?
oh man...
i could have warned you about stairs, rose!
_
47. RL30: =002385
IT KEEPS HAPENING
i told you rose
i TOLD you about stairs!
did you know he thinks puppets are cool?
he's so dumb!!
_
48. RL31: =002438
wow, that was so totally unnecessary!
you mean these stairs?
man, look at these shitty stairs...
they're so narrow! i'm supposed to climb those?
_
49. RL32: =002439
so why didn't you just build a way up through that hole into my dad's room?
no.
huh?
oh come on. what's the big deal, i'll just climb up and go right through!
yeah, why not?
well, i mean yeah...
wait are you saying there's something, like...
troubling in there?
what do you mean? what do you see in there?
oh.
pfff...
whatever!
i think i can handle a few more stupid clown paintings!
_
50. RL33: =002451
oh yeah, you're right.
dammit!
_
51. RL34: =002522
whoa, did you just make all these??
sweet, thanks!
what did you do with all the blue wobbly vase-looking things?
ok.
_
52. RL35: =002536
i combined the cards in the lathe thingy and made this!
it is so sweet, man look at me go.
thanks!
i got the idea from harry anderson.
uh, you know the show night court?
oh.
well bottom line is...
he's awesome
that's really all there is to say on the matter!
_
53. RL36: =002543
hey, that was a pretty, uh...
nice...
uh...
... save.
oh, yeah.
that.
this is pretty comfy.
why don't you just like, carry the bed around with me on it?
up to the gate up there!
oh.
lame!
well, ok.
well, ok.
all that scurrying around kind of wore me out, i think i'm going to rest here for a bit.
rose, can you keep the imps at bay? like, drop some stuff on them if they sneak too close.
what, come on!
oh alright.
i'm just gonna rest my eyes here a second though.
_
54. JH3: =002552
whoa, there you are!
it's ok, i am making some progress, and rose finally connected again so she is helping me now.
oh but, like...
i don't think i am actually saving the world here. :(
i dunno what i'm really accomplishing but i guess it's not that.
yeah, you're probably right.
but, um...
i don't think i mentioned nanna to you, did i?
hmm, i dunno, maybe you talked to rose or dave about it or something.
they're really weird when they talk to me about you, like they're always trying convince me you have some spooky powers, but i'm always like no she seems like a pretty regular girl to me!
but then when i think back maybe there are times when it seems like you know some things?
like maybe you know more about a thing than you are telling me? i dunno.
waiting for what!
oh yeah.
what ever happened with that?
yeah i know, tell me about it!
maybe you should like, wear an alarm clock or something.
so what was the deal with the meteor?
so what is it???
or is this just another thing you're "waiting" to tell me??? 
huh?
AUGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!
stop being so confusing!!!!
_
55. RL37: =002555
rose, why aren't you dropping something on that thing??
oh no
D:
_
Act 3
_
56. RL38: =002780
oh, hey!
you're back.
oh, so you mean dave connected with you?
um, ok.
i don't really think i get it.
is this relevant? 
_
57. NS8: =002785
ok nanna, i will.
hey, nanna?
since i am trying to get up to that gate, and since you can sort of conjure floating beds and throw me around and all...
couldn't you just throw me up to the gate?
oh, ok, i guess that's what i figured.
so just one more thing...
do you think that instead of telling me exactly why that is with a clear explanation, you can give me a series of really coy riddles about it and then sort of giggle?
ha ha, i guess.
i suddenly understand everything!
_
58. JH4: =002900
hey, happy birthday jade!
whew ok, i got your present in the mail JUST on time.
plus i sent rose's and dave's too.
why do your guys'es birthdays got to be all bunched together like that??? you are running me ragged!
i can't wait for you to see what i got you. i don't want to spoil it or anything but hopefully it will help you solve those problems you've been having lately.
MYSTERIOUS WINK ;)
oh man.
i am such an idiot, i forgot about how long it takes you to get stuff.
ARGH.
ok well i hope so.
oh god.
the trolls again?
they have been such a pain in the ass lately.
it seems like there are so many.
there are either like fifty of these retards or it's one guy with a lot of alt accounts.
what do they want with us!!!
oh hell no, shittiest pranksters ever.
oh wow, what? years??
ok, well i am sick of them.
i've been thinking of changing my pesterchum handle to throw them off the trail.
so...
i guess i'm gonna do that.
_
59. RL39: =002903
oh whoa hi!
oh...
gonna make some stuff.
are you ok? hasn't your house been on fire for like...
five hours now?
wow, congrats i guess?
nah.
his bro is probably busy kicking his ass.
that's probably all there is to say on the matter.
yeah, ok i hear you, but...
i think we'll have plenty. i've been killing imps all over the house and now its lousy with gushers.
i mean grist.
serves them right for ruining my posters. the bastards.
don't you see? my sweet movie posters. look at them, they're fucking ruined.
??????
uh, YEAH?
VERY FUNNY ROSE HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
_
60. RL40: =002904
NICE JOKE
GREAT JOKE THERE ROSE
TOP OF THE LINE PRANK
HE HE
HA HA HA HA HA
yes
YES
LET'S KEEP THIS JOKE GOING
BECAUSE IT IS SUCH A GOOD ONE
HA HA HA HA
OH MY
HA HA HA HA HA HA
HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA
_
61. RL41: =002922
ok, while i make some stuff here can you keep an eye out for imps?
just keep the safe or tub handy or something.
it'll serve them right for trashing my posters.
AND I KEEP TELLING YOU HA HA VERY FUNNY
yeah, i saw those, but...
they didn't look like that before. you must have changed them.
then why didn't you TELL me they were there???
ok, it still doesn't make sense though.
implying that i drew them a while ago and then forgot and couldn't see them and now suddenly see them.
that's stupid, what would that even mean.
_
62. RL42: =002923
yeah.
oh no, i just realized!
you are going to psycho-therapify me.
well don't bother!
maybe...
/EYES SUSPSICIOSLY
anyway i guess you saw what's in there, it's boring and there's not much to even see.
well...
i don't know, at first i was nervous to go in and find more of his weird clowns, because of course they are stupid and i hate them a lot.
but then when i didn't see any, it was weird.
i felt weirdly, like... disappointed almost.
yeah, i guess.
uh no, maybe not.
but what are you getting at?
it sounds like you're saying i'm crazy!
_
63. RL43: =002924
oh god.
see?? this is therapy bullshit!
why now?
but this is absurd, my dad LOVES these shitty clowns.
he's got all these statues and paintings EVERYWHERE.
i dunno.
not sure about all this.
but i think we need to stop and acknowledge the bunny sassacre fedora i just made.
yeah.
_
64. RL44: =002925
wow, what are you doing by the way?
rose, sorry to say but this is all looking kind of silly!
yeah no shit!
ok, but you really must be running low on time by now, right?

dear rose,
happy birthday!!!
thanks for being such a great friend all these years. i know you like to make it out like you're playing it cool and don't care much about the people in your life, but i know deep down you really do. hell, not even that deep down. it's like, um, like your subconscious is having a wet t-shirt contest, and you being all aloof is this totally soggy shirt doing no good at all at hiding nothin'. oh wait, it looks like two can play at this game of cracking all these high falutin psychology books! AW SNAP!!!
but yeah, i got you this because i think you're really creative and you could make something nice with it if you put your mind to it. and it might help you take your mind off a lot of all this serious business you're always absorbed in. you know, all this weirdo pseudo-gothy stuff or whatever. frankly it's kind of depressing.
anyway you're the best rose! have a rad 13th! (i will catch up with you guys soon. god you're all so old.)

68. DS10*: =002997
dear dave,
happy birthday!!!
i just wanted to take a break from telling you how much your gay butt stinks all the time and say what an awesome friend you are. seriously, on any other day i would be downplaying how you aren't really as cool as you think you are, but just between you and me i think you might actually be that cool. i think you just gotta get out of your bro's shadow and spread your wings dude!!!
so i got you these. they're totally authentic! they actually touched ben stiller's weird, sort of gaunt face at some point. i'm sure you'll dig them because i know you lolled so hard at that movie. ok so for real, this is sort of a shitty present, but it is an ironic present because i know you wouldn't have it any other way. maybe you can wear them ironically some time. they MIGHT even be more ironic than you and your bro's dumb pointy anime shades.
anyway, have a good one buddy! and stay busy being totally sweet!
~ghostyTrickster

69. JH7*: =003035
dear jade,
happy birthday!!!
it's hard to thank you enough for your friendship over the years. heck, if it weren't for you i wouldn't even have met rose and dave, so that is like, THREE TIMES the friendship! that is almost like, TOO MUCH FRIENDSHIP. ha ha. i only wish i could get you something for your birthday that could remotely make up for what you've given me, but of course that's impossible. so here are a couple silly things anyway!
i went to a weird asian store the other day and saw this rad shirt, so i got it and i'm wearing it now! but there was a blue one too which was way more awesome, and i wanted you to have it. i know you like green a lot, but maybe you'd like to try wearing blue sometimes? i bet you'd look like a million bucks! also i know you've been frustrated lately about how your pumpkins keep disappearing. well, i can't begin to explain why that's happening! all i can do is give you these so you can plant some more. don't give up, jade! wherever those dumb old pumpkins went off to, i'm sure you know the fun is in growing them and taking care of them until they're ready!
whew, got to head out to the post office now so this doesn't get to you TOO late! talk to you soon!!!

yeah, what's up with that, nanna? did the game make you all coy and prankstery when you became a sprite or were you always like that when you were alive?
ha ha ha... ok.
wait... so i'm the heir?
no!!!
nanna, are you there?
i just saw my house from below. what gives? why did the gate take me down here?
huh. alright. so i guess i scramble around down here until... uh, until what?
ok, so i get to that gate and go in. then what? where does it take me? uh... further up maybe? but i haven't even built that high yet.
yeah, well, i do nanna but i'm still not really getting it. does the next gate down here take me back up to the house or something?
please don't say hoo hoo hoo
nanna, there are more imps than ever down here, and they seem to be getting stronger.
no that's ok. also they look different.
huh?
whoa, wait, rose is here? where is she? will i find her down here somewhere???
nanna! dammit, will you stop messing around with those stupid imps for a second!
nanna? sigh...
what's up with this thing?
what kind of role? like frogs and stuff?
?????

RL - rose?
are you there?
i went through the gate, nanna said you might be here too.
are you in kind of this spooky glowy place with oily rivers and stuff?
let me know ok.
JH - hi jade!
guess where i am.
yeah!
wait how did you know that's where the gate goes...
did you talk to rose? can she still see me while im down here?
she won't answer.
oh man.
he sounds like such a handful.
but it's ok, i think he is mostly just looking after you.
like a guardian angel or something.
if i were you i would take him out behind the woodshed and give him a big hug.
oh? what game?
what, i thought you didn't even know what sburb was!
oh ok.
where did you even get it?
wow.
the thing you just said doesn't even make the slightes bit of sense.
oh really?
this is news to me.
oh yeah, i think so. it'll be kind of a long walk though, this place is huge.
okay.
wait, how did you know my dad's car fell down here?
jeeeeeeeeeeez!
ok fine well color me suspicious anyway.
miss knowitall mcpsychicpants.
ok sure i am convinced.
you have convinced me.
(PSYCHIC PSYCHIC PSYCHIC)
also i told you the package was in the car but i never mentioned that the game was there too.
so kind of totally busted i guess.
GIVE ME A P
GIVE ME AN S
ok, that is fair.
_
72. KV1: =003294
aaaaaauuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuggghhhhhhhh!!!!!!!
how did you find me?????
i changed my chum handle to ditch you guys.
how did you find me?
uh...
lame.
what, the last few months?
ok, this time i'll believe you that you aren't human.
because the skepticism center of my brain is starting to wear kind of thin i guess.
but you're still a major asshole and i don't actually want to talk to you, so bye.
hahahahahaha!
oh man, look at this outburst of little human words i'm saying!
from my human mouth!
that's the dumbest thing i've ever heard.
wait...
you have something to do with this game, don't you?
i should have known.
friendship isn't an emotion fucknuts.
why are you kissing my ass?
what do you want? why don't you just tell me what's going on.
are you in the medium?
like, here in this land, with the clouds and oil and stuff?
so why don't you just explain it again so i know...
so i don't ask so much in the future???
wow, yeah you're totally not trolling me, bro!
i see now we are bffs forever.
oh, ok.
so what do you want.
yeah, i don't blame her for not answering.
she pretty much can't stand you guys.
because of all the trolling you did before.
remember?
maybe.
we'll see.
i'm still not really sold on this friendship thing yet.
but i've got to go now and get on with my petty little quests.
so talk to you in the future i guess.
jerkface.

bluh bluh bluuuuuhhhhh.
ok, what words would you use, miss wordypants mcsmartybluh.
umm...
i haven't found an ocean yet.
but i dunno, the place is really big.
it's like a whole planet down here.
oh man, which reminds me.
i just got hounded by a troll.
yeah well, they say they want to be friends, also they're playing sburb but like not the same session as ours or something.
oh also they're moving backwards in time, which sounds really retarded, but whatever.
yeah, i guess answer him if you want. or not.
but anyway, it's great you made it here alive and stuff!
so dave came through?
for what?
oh, haha.
yeah, i'd feel kinda weird if dave was watching me too.
rose i feel weird when you're just TALKING to me, when you're watching me it's just like the weird frosting on the big weirdo cake.
yes i'm freeeeeeeeee :D
ok, i'm going to go over this river and through these woods.
you talk to your troll i guess.

oh, that's right...
the leetspeaking blind one.
go away!
which one, the blindness or the leetspeak.
sorry.
wow, you drive a hard bargain!
but nooooooooooooo.
yeah, well you're a huge...
oh man, whatever, what do you even want.
do you have a braille screen or something?
i don't really understand.
so you can "see" my whole future there, right?
by just like, scrolling around on some computer thing that lets you pick what time to talk to me?
how can you be bored by my long boring future, why don't you just scroll around to wherever you want like the other weirdos are doing?
oh ok, that sounds really great and helpful!
sounds dumb.
but if it means you're going to help me, then go ahead and help me i guess.
whoa, you've got a map?
where'd you get it?
can i have it?
ok.
_
78. TP3: =003480
this is the worst crap i have ever seen.
what am i looking at here?
ok sorry but it's useless.
what's with these colors.
couldn't you just, like...
crop the world map.
i thought you guys were THE BEST.
you mean The Breeze?
sure.

what?
i am just acting out a scene from an awesome movie and having some fun, what's wrong with that?
no, it's about these criminals on a runaway plane, and they've got to be stopped by nick cage and john cusack together as a team.
it is sweet, so sweet, you would probably like it.
hahaha, oh man, that sucked so bad!
don't you have alien movies from your alien planet?
ok, so what is a really good one?
well, i already laughed when you said the name of one of ours, so who cares?
wait...
this is the title?
how do you even say them in casual conversation?
ok, i just think it's still cumbersome and completely illogical.
well, i've got one of your godly players helping me now, so we can't be in such bad shape.
GC gave me a map.
and showed me a shortcut.
ok.
umm...
uh, sorry i guess?
i don't know why you guys are doing this to yourselves.
all this time jackassery, it's giving me a headache.
ok.
i like how you guys have basically resorted to trolling each other, through us.
oh, did you talk to jade yet?
ummm, that's what you said you wanted to do last time you talked to me, i dunno.
yeah, you told me dude.
want me to paste the conversation?
ok.
but next time you talk to me, you might want to tell me to calm down first so i don't just block you.
back then i won't really want to hear from you.
later.

80. TP4: =003504
it was carcino.
yeah, sorta.
he has no idea what you're doing.
oh, he said to give you a message...
he wants you to touch his bone lump or something.
and that he's pretty much basically in love with you.
yeah, i dunno, pretty much.
ohhh no, we're not going down that road!
besides, it was a private conversation among private gentlemen colleagues.
oh, also you're going to punch him.
i guess in your future.
but in your pretty soon future i think.
it's when he says stuff to you and then you laugh at him. 
also he says you said it's from me.
pffff, i don't care!
i'm just the timey-wimey messenger here.

81. TP5: =003503
oh, wow.
what's that?
my denizen?
ok...
so you want me to go down there and kill him?
won't that be, uh, kinda hard?
oh?
so what's my advantage?
um, ok.
what's the point of releasing the grist hoard?
is it just so i can make tons more sweet loot?
what's the ultimate alchemy?
alright.
_
82. TP6: =003506
so this is the seventh gate?
that'll take me into the palace and down to the sleeping denizen? 
_
83. TP7: =003533
the rocket pack?
ok...
but you can't just "subtract" object codes from other codes!
it's like, mathematically, um...
ambiguous.
like just reverse AND/OR'ing the flower pot alone could make hundreds of possibilities.
subtracting all three could be millions!
wow, what?
oh man, you have a hacker?
i bet he is THE BEST!!!!
hackers are always the best.
who is it?
have i talked to him?
uh, ok.
brb then.

hello?
it thought you said you'd be back in less than a second?
oh...
i just thought that was just you going off to get the code...
and making like this rockety noise or something, i dunno.
because you're kind of goofy.
oh gosh, i'm sooooo sorry!
this is just a stupid code, i'm sorry.
are you sure it's right, it seems kind of...
obvious.
bluuuh, oh man, i got so served, bluuuuuuuuuh!
well you see, the explanation is perfectly simple and scientific.
it was because shut up.
shut up is why.
i guess i'll make this rocket now.
and see if this dumbass code actually does the trick.

so nasty! gross dude!!!
i'm in a rocket pack and i am about to blast off into space. 
it should be sweet.
hmm...
have you asked rose?
wow, really?
i don't really know, i mean...
it's supposed to be like your ghostly spirit guide or something.
unless you have the remains of a wise old dead grandparent lying around, i'm not sure what to tell you!
i don't know, just do what it says!
it knows stuff about the game, so it probably knows better than i do...
i gotta go!
gonna blast off to the seventh gate.
and, uh, win this game i guess.
later.

remember, you are talking to the pranking MASTER.
if future you is real, then why don't you let me talk to him.
hold on, someone else is bugging me.
hahaha!
wow, you're really pulling out all the stops for this stunt!
using your phone and computer at the same time to message me.
you're kind of going through a lot of trouble actually, i don't know why you're bothering with this. 
you can't track down through time WHAT YOU CAN'T CATCH!
pchoooooo!
no...
but that would have been sweet if i did just then.
ok, i guess...
_

yeah, of course!
there was no way i wasn't trying out this sweet ride.
relax, i'm not going through the gate!
i am just flying around, and having a good time in the sky.
um...
ok, i don't know anything about that...
but it doesn't matter!
you're my best bro, and if you say not to go then i won't go.
hey, can you hold on?

ok, brb.

humans aren't hatched as larvae dummy.
we don't hatch at all.
we are born as these like little pink monkeys called babies.
what did i say?
i thought you didn't like going down that road?
copy-pasting future/past conversations...
i dunno, that's what you just told me.
hahaha!
i was punking you dude!
or at least i will be in our next conversation.
thanks for the great prank idea.
i don't know, it was just a friendly prank.
don't you ever play pranks?
i mean, of course you do, one of you just tried to prank me good.
pffffff, you'll find out.
well, we're friends by then, aren't we?
or sort of like, uh, reverse anti-mutual friends.
look, you're going to have to face it at some point...
that you're learning the meaning of this human emotion called friendship.
yes, absolutely.
dude, you've been doing the same exact thing!!!
you never answer my questions, though.
how am i supposed to know what's going, or what you're alluding to?
ok...
what's the point of the game.
augh!
fine.
where are you now?
no no, i know that!
you already told me.
yes, in your future.
what i mean is...
are you in your house right now, or in one of your magical lands, or what?
just curious cause you can see me, but i can't see or know anything about you!
what's that?
derse?
well jeez, how am i supposed to know any of this??
ok, so the veil is a bunch of meteors...
what do you mean "what's left of it"?
ok...
so then it's up to us to save it?
ok, but it sounds like we've got plenty of time before that happens, right?
oh no...
what is it?
yeah, well...
maybe you're wrong!
maybe there's something we can still do to stop it, if you just help us?
ok, we'll see about that, mr. sourbulge.
hey, aren't you kind of uncomfortable sitting on a meteor?
are you all huddled in a crater or something? 
seeds?
um...
well, what kind of crazy shit is there?
weird.
wow, i don't think i'm following this.
ok, but wait...
can you give a message to GC for me?
tell her nice try.
oh, well i thought you'd be cool with it since you asked me to give her a message for you last time.
but whatever.

i don't know, i thought you were ok for a while, but now you are kind of giving me the creeps!
what?
you mean my earth jesus?
do you have a troll jegus?
wow, really?
or is this a joke?
well...
neither do i, i guess.
it's pretty much not anything.

GC.
she told me how to get to the 2nd gate.

another prank!
oh...
then, i don't really get this.
wow, ok.
ok...
how do you know all this?
oh yeah...
you're the orange dave.
hey no offense, but do you think i could talk to the real dave for a second?
wow, calm down!
i'm sorry, that's not really what i meant...
i mean, of course you're a real dave, but what i mean is...
the dave from my time is also my friend, and i guess he's in the same boat i'm in, not knowing stuff and all.
and i'd feel bad keeping him out of the loop!
DS - oh, hey.
i think i pissed off your future self.
i said he wasn't the real dave.
i think i might have really hurt his feelings though!
why not?
ok.
i'm in rose's room by the way.
yeah, but she's asleep!
ok.
DaSp - sure!
hey dave...
in case i forgot to say so before...
thanks for saving my life!
_
94. DS18: =003593
man, i don't know how i feel about that!
i don't really like the idea of capering around her room while she's asleep, it feels weird.
i'm going to wake her up.
a future thing?
well, yeah, she won't wake up.
so i guess so.
but i'm not snooping!!!
yeah.
they look sorta like journals.
i don't think i should read those!
uh, ok.

wait a minute!
i see what you're trying to do.
i won't tell you the code for rose's books!
ok...

yeah there's a code.
HAHA DAVE,
I THINK ALL THIS LAUGHING MADE ME POOP IN MY PANTS TOO HARD.
oh, yeah, i think it might be.
yeah, maybe.
i wonder if she finished...
she was so tight lipped about the damn thing! i am really curious.
_
96. KM*1: =003614
she's not here right now, she's asleep!
but ok, see you.
umm... no?
oh, yeah.
that's me! i am the rose human. look at me, i am so smart with all these snooty words and complicated things to say.
i am the queen of books.
fffuuhhhhhhhh
i'm so burned, these burns are crazy.
can we just cut to the chase and be friends already??
these cat and mouse games are so dumb, you know we're just going to all be friends at some point anyway.
i don't know, uh, maybe???
it's hard to keep track with all your time nonsense.
thgat's because you guys always do things the hard way.
and the dumb way.
haha, well i know what you guys look like.
you look kind of like...
howie mandel from little monsters.
even though, to be perfectly frank, he was kind of a big monster.
because he was a big goofy adult.
and fred savage was like his child prankster sidekick.
no, it's a movie.
you should ask john about it, because he thinks it's awesome, which it is.
yeah, i got him this really cool bunny for his birthday, and it's really nicely knitted and everything.
because i am basically in love with him, you are right.
heh, just kidding. i'm sure john knows it's cause i am really thoughtful and i bet he really appreciates the present, and would say thank you if he were here!
why don't you talk to john?
oh man, i don't know.
why don't you pick the time that will make the most complicated mess out of everything imaginable?
you know that's what you're gonna do anyway.
ok.
if you talk to him in the past...
he'll understand even less buggywhipped fuckall about time, and he'll be confused.
so maybe paste something from this conversation to him? i don't know.
and if you talk to him in the future...
he'll probably know all this stuff, like things you've said to him but haven't said yet!
and then you'll be confused.
sorry, that's just how this works.
don't say i didn't warn you!
yeah, bye!
(heheheheheheh)

you killed him for it?
how'd you get it then?
ok.
_
98. KV4: =003803
what point?
oh man, i must be getting closer to the conversations where you're trolling me harder!
this is pretty exciting, i can't wait to see what you've got up your sleeve.
anyway, you weren't making a point about the ultimate riddle, dude.
nope, we never talked about it.
yet...
oh, you're just starting to figure that out now?
oh my god, i know, you've already told me like a million times!!!
man, i've got to say i'm a little disappointed by this "masterful trolling" you were bragging about.
maybe, but that would be pretty weak too!!!
w/e.
so what was the "case in point" you were making, anyway?
whoa, i am?
wait...
these are baby versions of us?
well...
i saw footage of my nanna, and some other people who i am pretty sure were like jade's grandpa and rose's mom and stuff from a long time ago.
and then...
there were all these little guys scurrying around.
so they are like cloned copies of us?
huh?
what do you mean they are literally us?
do they go back in time?
what is the riddle anyway?
maybe i can guess, i am good at riddles!
a distaction, perhaps?
nevermind.
ok.
well, if i run into some salamanders who tell me all about this riddle and get really excited about it, i will try to act surprised.
so this is the same kind of thing you went through?
with, like, being your own paradox clones and creating your own parents and stuff?
how did that even work, with 12 of you?
huh...
yeah, i guess now that you mention it, i am finding it all a little strange...
no, no, i mean the ghost stuff and paradoxes are one thing of course...
it's something else.
it's just...
this is really weird...
well, normally humans hatch...
from like these slimy pods.
then we wriggle out as a little pink larva.
(hehehehehehehe)
um...
sure...?
hey, i have an idea.
why don't you get back to me in a few minutes?
i mean like a few minutes of my time, not yours.
all of these little pink monkeys are getting way out of line and i have to tend to them.
if you message me in a couple minutes, we can continue conversing in a sane, linear fashion for a change!
and then after that you can keep going backwards and then make fun of me riding my little red rocket.
you can tell me i look like a silly little paradox clone fresh out of my slime tube and this is just all a big nurseytime recess jamboree.
that would burn me good!
(hehehehehehehehehehehe)
_
99. KV5: =003807
yeah!
wait!
i was just looking at all these rascals, and i was wondering...
how they go back in time and become us and stuff.
does it have something to do with the reckoning?
you told me.
we had this great dare going.
to see who could be the least helpful and informative.
and you totally lost, dude!
you were hella helpful.
oh, wow.
is that the title of a movie too?
ha ha, that isn't even true and doesn't make sense!
well yeah, the dare never happened, i was joking around and made that up to give you hard time.
i am wearing a lab coat!
sort of...
that's bullshit!
do you even have elves?
uh, what?
ok.
wait!!!
so that means...
we are all sort of like superman?
cool!
yeah, superman is pretty cool, i guess.
did you know nicolas cage was almost going to play superman one time?
wait!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
get back to me in a couple minutes, ok?
_
100. KV6: =003829
sure, i guess.
what are you talking about?
ok...
i was sort of mulling it over while looking at all these babies with guns and sitting on ponies and things...
and how the reckoning takes them back.
and how you said our reckoning starts sooner.
are you sure it has to start so soon? can't we delay it?
oh... dang!
i guess i better get off this meteor then!
ok, well you keep saying how doomed we are and how all this bad stuff happens sooner, but you never say why!
what happens in our game that's different from yours that makes things go so badly?
_
101. KV7: =003830
who is jack noir?
so you didn't have him in your game?
i see.
so after he got exiled and all that, he came here into our game and caused all this trouble?
ummmm...
crash bandicoot?
like an ace?
ok, i think i get it.
but how did he do that? what was different about what we did versus what you did?
oh no!
what is the worst thing?
dammit!
oh, hey...
sorry, hold on, this little lady is bugging me about something.
oh!!!!!
oh man, i just had THE BEST idea, this is so perfect.
a blonde mother and daughter together, this is totally perfect.
it is like that scene in con air, i will give her the bunny like i am nick cage fresh out of the slammer.
i wish i had a filthy wifebeater on, oh well.

hi karkat!
oh man.
this is it, isn't it?
i've been looking forward to this!
no, i mean this is the first conversation between us, from your perspective.
right?
yeah, lots of times!
actually...
i shold introduce myself properly.
hi karkat, i am john!
because we are buddies!
yup, we totally are.
we just became earth human buddies in a kind of weird way.
you decide to keep talking to me backwards through my adventure.
and then when you are done with that you come back and talk to me more recently on the timeline for a while.
you talk to my friends a whole bunch too.
you and your alternian troll buddies help me and my earth human buddies hatch a plan!
which we are busy putting into motion right now, as you can see.
yeah yeah, i know.
you mean the scratch?
yes! that is the plan.
yo yourself said it was the only hope now.
heheheh.
egbert.
man...
i knoooow.
none of this is news to me, karkat!
but to be quite honest, it doesn't sound like your intentions were all that great.
wanting to be tyrants and all.
maybe you got what you deserved, you stutid fuckass!
eh, it's an in-joke, never mind.
anyway, hey!
i thought this was supposed to be the conversation where you do all that AMAAAAAZING TROLLING!
come on bro, flame me!
i have been really excited about this.
um...
i don't know, probably not.
i just think it's kind of funny when you do it.
right about what?
ha ha, i don't hate you!
wait...
are you saying that we are kisme-whatevers?
er...
uh.
well...
i just didn't really have any idea that you had any sort of feelings like that, so i am kind of caught off guard.
hey, i don't have a problem with your weird sort of alien hate--love thing!
it is just that, uh...
i am not a homosexual.
it is like, when a boy likes another boy.
or i guess hates, in this case.
yes.
shrug. it just is.
i am just as confused by your troll shenanigans.
so many shenanigans!
anyway, i kind of got the impression that you and terezi were a thing.
like, i dunno.
going on weird fight dates and beating the crap out of each other, and being in hate-love or love-hate.
isn't that how it works?
ew.
um, i talked to you...
and her...
and some others. i don't know! like i said it's just a sense i got.
sorry!
oh god, the quadrants...
ok, sheesh!
karkat, i am going to be honest...
this first conversation is not going how i thought it would at all!
it is really kind of...
awkward.
yeah...
well...
um...
yeah, well we never really talked about it in the past, so i guess we do agree to that.
told you bro!!!!!!!
hahahaha.
you mean platonic hate?
oh yeah.
oh boy, this sounds great.
but...
we're out of time!
i have to go put this plan into motion.
:D
see you soon!
_
103. VS1: =004553
heheh. i am pronouncing that like a really long "june".
that is so many o's.
you typed my name in 64 bit.
have i talked to you before?
i'm pretty sure i remember you. you hassled me a long time ago.
i think you threatened to kill me at some point.
well, yeah, i know that about you guys by now.
but also i know that it is probably not exactly an empty threat!
since one of you already managed to trick me into getting myself killed.
well, in another timeline at least.
terezi?
huh. it never really occurred to me to ask what your names are.
kinda rude of me!
what is yours?
man, that sounds so made up!
but if you say so, marquise.
oh, ok.
ok, i will be sure to let my guard down.
psyche!!!!!!!!!
oh damn, that was 9 !'s.
!!!!!!!1
shit!
never mind.
anyway, nice meeting you spinneret.
if you don't mind, i would like to try to go back to sleep.
i was dreaming about something important.
oh god, i forgot!
poor jade... :(
i hope she is alright.
yeah, you're right.
i have to hurry and go save her!
see ya!
oh yeah...
duh, stupid stupid dumb.
do you know where i am supposed to get it?
hmm...
ok?
meh.
so, you seem to like 8's a whole bunch, and i guess you are like, kind of spidery themed or something?
haha, spiders are gross!
_
104. VS2: =004561
jade is not answering!
are you sure she's ok?
oh...
you mean carcino geneticist?
heheh. car cat. that is how i am saying that.
beep beep, meow!
i will have to remember to give him a hard time about that.
it is really not hard to do that.
i never even saw prospit.
aside from flaming bits and pieces of it i guess.
something happened, and it blew up, and dream jade died, and then i was wandering around this place that was like a chess board with a huge crater in it, with loads of dead black and white guys everywhere.
oh, huh.
my dad was there.
um, you know...
my guardian?
yes. if by hive you mean house.
um...
these observations are very alien of you.
but that's pretty cool i guess, seeing as you are an alien.
the funny thing is, he is not even really my dad.
i mean, i was adopted by him, although we are not actually unrelated, i think.
he is the son of my grandmother, who isn't really my grandmother...
nanna is sort of like my biological mother, and my biological father would be jade's grandpa, sorta.
both of which i just created, with slime and stuff, and sent back in time as babies.
so i guess, if anything, that makes my dad...
my half brother???
tell me about it!
_
105. VS3: =004562
but i know where i'm going!
terezi already made me a map.
first she made a really crappy one, then a really nice one that works kind of like google.
she started helping me after she tried to kill me.
wow, how could i possibly know that!
you mean like a candle light hate date?
oh...
well then, thanks, i guess?
why do you want to be so helpful, anyway?
i mean, with her i got the sense she was being kind of jokestery about it, which is something i can understand.
but why bother helping, if we aren't going to win anyway?
you guys.
it is practically all you ever say.
_
106. VS4: =004563
that is nice to know.
yes, i think i would be.
but why else?
we are supposed to create a universe?
no!
why are we supposed to do that?
oh. that's true, i guess.
you did?
hmm...
i don't know what to think about that.
hurrrrr oh man what a burn!
(j/k it was actually lame.)
well to be honest, i never really believed any of your guys's doom and gloom nonsense.
not because i think you are lying...
i just feel like there must still be a way to win!
yes, i agree.
also, there is always hope for someone who has good friends to count on!
_
107. VS5: =004572
um, i don't know. you can see my future, can't you?
how much time am i wasting?
then i would venture to guess i am wasting time because you chose to pester me just now!
i mean, i was just pausing for a moment...
to look at my trashed movie posters.
they bring back memories, of a life that i guess is long gone now.
but you probably know what that is all about.
it wasn't even that long ago, but it already seems like forever since i was on earth!
it was a pretty nice place, i bet you would have liked it.
well, what about you? do you miss your planet, and your parents and such?
oh. that's too bad.
but you see, that is where you are wrong. these films are the finest earth has to offer!
no, no. i drew those clowns in my sleep, for some reason.
this one here is so great. it is about this street tough renegade who did hard time behind bars, and wants nothing more in the world than to reunite with his loving wife and daughter. but not so fast! he has to go on crazy and dangerous escapades through the sky with a motley assortment of rogues led by john malkovich, who is wise to cage's heroic nature and pure heart. they tether a grumpy police man's awesome car to the plane and smash it, and then later they crash into some casinos. cage gets out of the wreckage and hugs his family, and i usually tear up a little.
that is my working troll title for the movie, i hope it was ok.
yeah, well you are hilariously WRONG!
here, hang on, i will show you.
http://tinyurl.com/hullohumminburr
oh, but you will probably have to use your troll thingy to rewind time or whatever, to before the earth internet blew up so you can watch it.
i guess??
ok, suit yourself.
but there it is, in case you are ever hankering after some incredible movie magic.
ok, good idea.
_
108. VS6: =004573
oh, the goggles are cool and all, but they kind of restrict my vision stupidly when i'm using them!
i should remember to make a new hands-free device, that is less obtrusive.
maybe after i make a new computer so i can install this game.
yeah, but i can use one of my old previously punched cards.
what?
put what away? what are you talking about?
_
109. VS7: =004574
my pail?
you mean this bucket here?
umm...
i'm really not following. what do you have against buckets?
shame over what?
it's just a bucket! you know, for putting soapy water in and cleaning stuff with.
why, what do trolls use them for?
wow... uh. that is definitely pretty odd.
but ok, i'm sorry you saw my bucket. i will just chuck it out the window i guess.
well i was GOING to but you started babbling at me!
jeez, spinneret.
ok, then what is it!
*ROLLS EYES*
all eight gross spidery eyes!
oops i mean !x8
oh yeah.
_
110. RL48: =004582
hey rose!
how are you doing? i don't even remember the last time we talked.
i have been so busy.
and it looks like you have been too.
i mean, hopy shit!
my house is HUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGE!
oh.
well, it must have cost a fortune!
how much?
torrented?
you got her to do that? but she's an old lady! also, a ghost.
also, she is really tricky, and plays lots of pranks.
did she try to prank you?
huh.
i guess you enjoyed the prankster's gambit on that exchange then.
oh yeah...
what's up with the alchemiter?
it looks weird.
did you get nanna to do that too?
the salamanders??
they aren't very smart...
i'm surprised they even understand what to do.
yeah...
uh...
what exactly does that mean?
what have you been doing this whole time???
well,
i have been talking to a lot of trolls, for one thing.
they sure are a talkative bunch!
and then i cloned some slime babies in the veil.
yes. um...
ok, long story short is, jade is my slime clone sister, and dave is your slime clone brother, and we were all born today!
yes?
oh.
umm...
then i fell asleep, and woke up on the battlefield.
oh!
rose, i am fairly sure i saw your mom!
well, it was a nice and proper looking lady, with a pink scarf, so...
i dunno, who else would that be!
fine, i guess...
she was with my dad.
yeah!
happy?
wow, i dunno.
i don't really know her well enough to say, i guess?
plus, i was a little distracted.
maybe i will find out next time i go to sleep.
now stop being so spookily mysterious and tell me what you've been doing!
investigating what?
its scope?
oh, rose, did you know that we are supposed to be creating a universe with this game?
i think that's pretty neat!
so you believe the trolls then?
it is?
that's a bit of a bummer!
i am still skeptical about that, though.
huh?
that's stupid.
i'm not your leader, i am your FRIEND, there is a BIG difference!
pff.
laaaaaaaame.
so, if you're sure that we are going to fail...
what is the point of everything we're doing?
um...
i mean, what are we actually shooting for here?
i suddenly don't understand anything.
_
111. KM2: =004605
hi...?
ha ha, what?
so you're a time traveler?
so let me see if i have this straight...
you are a time traveling space alien from the future, sent here to study humans?
are you from mars? is it a mission of peace?
what does your time machine look like? a phone booth? phone booths are a popular thing for some reason.
were you lured to earth by a huge gyroscopey thing that jodie foster piloted in contact, while matthew mcconaughey sort of acted as her spiritual guide i guess...
and then he kind of preached to her about having faith instead of believing in the sciences so hard all the time, and i guess in the end she believed him, maybe?
actually, im not even sure what the point of mcconaughey was in that movie. but he was still awesome.
and then jodie found her dad on an alien planet... but i think he was a ghost or something? or maybe an alien in disguise.
and then she went home and nobody believed her, but you just KNOW mcconaughey believed her.
because he had all the faith. and i mean ALL OF IT.
anyway, does that have any applicability to your cosmic interstellar astrojourney?
pff, i know i'm dumber than rose, that is not much of a burn, dude!
oh, sorry.
i don't know why i thought you were.
were you trolling rose too?
TIME TRAVEL TROLLING???
oh boy, let me go put on my quantum space hat, and extra terrestrial adventure boots, and you can tell me all about it.
ha ha ha. i don't follow!
hahaha! oh man, you blew it!
now i know for sure you're trolling me. rose hates that movie.
possibly! i know that sure didn't sound like her.
but i think it's more likely that you made it all up cause you know i like that movie.
so i tip my cap to you, well played miss troll!
ok well, just between you and me...
SOMEONE here is getting trolled.
and it just might be all three of us.
but you shoulda told me you liked little monsters!
we could jam about that. what was your favorite part?
i really want to get a little monsters poster, but they're hard to find!
i asked my dad for one for christmas. fingers crossed!
yup, that sure keeps sounding alien of you.
keep up the good work!
listen, i'm kind of busy, i have to wrap this present and mail it in a hurry.
so i'm going to block you!
but i might unblock you again soon, because you're kinda cool.
yeah well...
you might just hear from me!
also, you should give rose another chance.
she is really great! whatever she did, she was probably just pulling her mind games on you, it's all in fun.
there is more to her than that, you'll see.
bye!
_
112. VS8: =004624
oh hey.
but...
it is bill cosby.
he's back.
in laptop form.
excuse me, but spending just a little quality time with my man bill here is not a w8stey w8ste at all.
no amount of 8's in words will make that true.
of course i do! jeez!
ok, i'm going.
_
113. VS9: =004625
what?!?!?!
i am going to blast off and fly a little higher, to see if i can find nanna up there!
and then i will install the game.
it will only take a second!
jeez!!!
you are incredibly bossy.
more like marquise bossyfangs.
no, you did not tell me that you like to play troll dungeons and dragons.
i will find out what your name is, i am tricky and i have ways.
i don't know what i'm going to do next!
apparently what i thought i was going to do next was wrong, so why don't you tell me?
has it occurred to you that i might be wasting so much time because you keep pestering me telling me how much time i'm wasting?
and then when i'm about to make progress you tell me i am doing the wrong thing!
if it weren't for you i would be playing this game already.
but it isn't!
oh...
but why would i do that? my ecto labsuit is rad!
:(
what is a boy skylark?
actually, i think i remember passing that rung on my echeladder a while ago.
who cares what i dress like? it is what's inside the adventurer that counts.
why are you taking such an interest in my fashion, anyway?
ha ha, it sounds like you have a really lame culture.
laaaaaaaame.
oh, ha ha...
i didn't even count. it just...
turned out like that.
yeah.
er...
ok, anyway, i will make a new suit, but i am not ditching my ectosuit!!!
it is so sweet, i look like link, if zelda was a quest about an elf scientist.
i am the wind waker. it's me.
_
114. VS10: =004632
jegus?
how do you know about jegus? do you even know what that is?
no. well, yeah kind of.
it is a misspelling of an adult male bearded human, who was magic.
uh, yes. it is.
i dunno. i found it, and i decided to captchalogue it for some reason.
frogs are pretty cool.
huh. ok...
apparently is is considered illegal contraband.
why would a frog be illegal?
bossy!!!!!!!!
bossy bossy bossy bossy bossy bossy bossy bossy.
to the eighth power.
times eight infinities!!!
that was nine !'s.
_
115. VS11: =004634
so, uh...
red sneakers, some jeans, a tee shirt, and another shirt...
this is the fabulous outfit you had in mind?
it's pretty cool and all...
i was just picturing something...
more elaborate? like maybe more adventurey.
what?
ok, jeeeeeeeez.
_
116. VS12: =004635
pchoo.
ha ha, just messin' with ya.
pchoooooooo!
_
117. VS13: =004636
ok...
marquise bossyfangs mcsekret, this has been a lot of fun...
but i have to go talk to my pals now, and also rescue jade!
oh yeah. sure, if you say so.
that's too bad.
how long will it be?
ha ha, i guess...
ok i will try.
thanks for all the help. bye, ms. serket!
Anderson.
(hehehehehehehehe)
_
118. DS20: =004637
hey dave!
wow, it's been a while since we talked, hasn't it.
i think the last time i talked to you, i was doing exactly what im doing now...
which is blasting off from my house.
or was it?
wow, i can't remember...
oh.
you mean like the trolls?
are you using the troll time chat gizmo?
oh ok. is this dave sprite?
well, excuse me, but i still think time travel sounds kind of special.
sorry you are so jaded by awesome shit!
boondollars? i thought they didn't do anything.
what do they do?
what do they buy?
uh...
how much do you need?
oh, fuck that!!!
but you just said it wasn't useless!
really? when?
how far in the future are you from?
i thought we only had something like 24 hours until, like...
game over.
wow. how...
i don't get how that works!
but, doesn't going back in time make an alternate reality?
i thought that's what happened with dave sprite, he came back to make sure i didn't die and this is a new timeline now.
daves, plural?
oh, man.
help?
sounds like you have been talkin' to some trolls!
they seem to be getting more talkative lately.
yeah, that makes sense.
i guess since you've lived three days in one day, you've just been hassled that much more?
heheh.
so what is the future like?
or uh, the 3x future...
do we win???
but...
i worked hard saving up that money!
i have a whole boonbuck now.
:(
tell me what you want with it!
lohacse?
um...
lohac?
oh, huh.
that sounds unpleasant.
your unpleasant face is what kicks ass!
or DOESN'T, more like.
j3gus?
*narrows eyes suspiciously...*
i don't even know how to give it to you!
they are just more weird gaming abstractions, how do we do this?
i'm really pretty busy you know. i have to help jade!
bluh...
fiiiiiiiine.
who?
_
119. VS14: =004684
hey vriska!
ok, i still cannot find my nanna up here, so now i am just installing this game.
what are you up to?
why not? you guys do it all the time.
bluh...
that's dumb. i'm going to talk to you whenever i want!
well, i didn't know it was your name for sure until you just told me now.
so, haha.
heheh, i am not telling.
a true wise guy never reveals his tricks.
nuh uh!
anyway, i was just wondering if you had a chance to watch that awesome video i linked you to?
you know...
the one about the renegade hero who busted loose from the slammer to save the day.
just do it, you won't be sorry.
i mean, when you are not so busy and have less irons in the fire or whatever.
ok, i am starting this game now and saving jade, like a street tough maverick with nothing to lose.
see ya, vriska!
oh, damn...
_
120. VS15: =004685
fuck.
_
121. KV9: =004688
oh no.
which conversation is this for you? your second or so?
i mean...
the second time you have spoken to me?
or first??
oh.
i thought you were going backwards though.
memo?
uh...
ok.
_
122. DS21; KV10: =004690
ok, i am here.
ok, hi dave!
what is going on in here?
yeah, dave, don't go!
i think we should listen to what he has to say. 
haha, dave you're hitting on terezi? really??
karkat, is terezi really your girlfriend?
what is so different about your romance?
what's a quadrant? how many do you have?
wow, okay!
who cares, jeeeeeeeez.
what does?
what!
no way. vriska's cool, i'll talk to her all i want!
well, yeah...
but terezi killed me in an alternate timeline, so that isn't too bad i guess.
plus, i am pretty sure that she is sorry about it.
wait...
are you saying that vriska is interested in me?
like, romantically?
oh man.
uh...
i'm not sure what to think about this.
dave, what do you think i should do?
well, like i said, i thought she was pretty cool...
kinda bossy! but also pretty friendly.
mcconaughey!!!!!!!!
um, wow, i don't know.
i mean, yeah, sure it would be fun to do something like that with her, i think.
but...
beyond that, it's a little confusing!
i don't think i have ever actually liked a girl before in that way, so i am not really sure what i am supposed to feel or do...
uh oh!
yeah, i dunno dave, i have talked to karkat a lot and i really don't think he has a thing for me.
uh...
er...
do...
you think that vriska is going to try to make out with me?
rose and jade?
so, uh...
you want us to like, date them?
i think he is right, i think we are all a little young to be thinking about that!
um, also,
we are kinda all related! sort of. through shared ghost slime genes. right?
so, uh...
wow, i have to marry rose?
uh...
wow.
why not?
_
123. NS11: =004698
nanna, what the heck!!!
really?
but nanna, did you know he is not really my dad? and also, i am not technically your grandson.
you are actually sort of my mother.
huh, oh yeah.
don't you find it all a little strange?
heheh.
so where have you been, nanna? i have been looking all over for you.
_
124. NS12: =004699
you have?
yeah!
now i am an ectobiolo...
ectobiblio... shit!
(oops! sorry.)
ectobioblobabby sitter.
damn it, you know what i mean. 
thanks!
boon?
_
125. NS13: =004700
ok. what is it?
oh cool, that is great!
hmm, i guess it has been a good while!
i've been snacking on gushers a whole lot. bluh...
i never realized how terrible they were, actually.
_
126. NS14: =004701
oh boy!
wow, hmm...
uh... no?
really? already?
_
127. NS15: =004702
naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!
_
128. JH9: =004768
whoa, hey!
you're awake!
oh, yeah.
i am pretty sure that i...
he?
am/is fine.
i woke up on the battlefield which was on fire, and had flaming bits of prospit everywhere.
oh, you mean jack?
that is his name, karkat told me.
i saw him there too.
oh!!!!!
i also got your present, and it saved my life!
yes, the bunny was so awesome, it was definitely the best bunny i got today.
thank you so much, jade!
when jack saw it, he flew the hell away. and then the bunny and i went on an adventure together.
does the bunny have a name? i asked him but i don't think he can talk.
oh, i did not even think of that.
well if she grew up as a girl, then it's not right for me to suddenly make her a boy.
hmm...
you have no idea how tempted i am to name her casey again.
yes, i named a young salamander casey earlier, but then i left her at rose's house.
yes, but she was asleep.
also, apparently i am supposed to marry rose. karkat said so.
it is true, it is a fact from an alien.
heheh, i did not take him that seriously.
but karkat is cool, he is angry and funny.
haha, no!
that sounds kind of awesome.
i've got it.
i will name her liv tyler.
the bunny.
yeah!
it's too bad i can't marry liv instead of rose.
the girl i mean, not the bunny.
but i guess she is probably dead now, along with all the other glamorous movie stars who come out to shine on the silver screen.
that's pretty sad.
the lab?
oh, no. why?
ok. why, is there a secret in there?
what is it?
oh...
errr...
i have sort of already seen... that.
not in the lab, but on the battlefield.
it's ok.
i was so confused and sad when i saw you lying there....
i'd rather not talk about it i guess.
but, i wonder..
if your dream self died...
then what were you just dreaming about now?
ok, that's cool.
oh, also...
i found your ring.
yes...
but then i woke up, and didn't have it anymore.
so i am not sure where it is now.
oh, whoa.
ok, i will do that.
hey jade, we have a lot to catch up on, but how about later?
we have to hurry, remember there is a big meteor heading for you right now?
i will find out now!
_
129. JH10: =004778
oh fuck!
_
130. JH11: =004780
ok, we have 10 minutes and 25 seconds.
why would it be significant?
numbers don't always need to have significance!
ok, well the number is now less than it was, and therefore less significant.
and by less, i mean more! you had better hurry upstairs and make your special item.
hey, what do you think we should prototype this fussy little orb with?
heheheh, it seems like so long ago that rose fed mine a clown.
we were just messing around, we didn't even know what we were doing.
yeah...
it's almost like your grandpa put all this crap here knowing we'd have to make that decision.
he seems like he was an awesome guy, i would have liked to have the chance to talk to him.
oh?
huh...
wait, are you saying we will prototype him?
like i did with nanna, to bring her ghost back to life?
as...
another ghost?
i guess that makes a lot of sense, actually.
yeah, also he brought back himself from the future.
who... wasn't dead, but was going to die maybe? i dunno.
specifically to save my life, as well as yours, i think.
yes.
it's pretty neat, i guess.
i just messaged him, he is not answering.
ehhh, he's fine, he has been doing a lot of time traveling.
i talked to him from the future, so he must be ok now to make it that far.
yes, that is why we need to get you in the loop!
the loop being the game. hurry upstairs! your transporty pad thingies take you straight up, right?
oh, wait!!!
what do we do about prototyping?
we shouldn't put your grandpa in yet, unless we want lots of imps and ogres and stuff that look like your grandpa.
we could put in something really lame, to make all the monsters weaker!
or at the very least, more ridiculous looking.
like one of these weird pictures of blue ladies lying around.
what's the deal with those, anyway?
i guess we could just put nothing in and see what happens.
i don't see why not.
maybe i will ask rose, because she suddenly understands everything for some reason.
we have ten minutes to think about it.
whoops! i mean a lot less than ten minutes!
hurry upstairs, go go go!!!
_
131. JH12: =004787
what is this thing, anyway??
and why is it blocking your transporter?
typheus?
like the web browser?
hmm, i don't know...
if you think numbers always mean something, why wouldn't browser names?
wow, you sure do hate that thing!
i think it is pretty cool.
and he is actually sort of cute to be honest, :p
oh, and screw you, typheus is an awesome browser!
it is old school.
typheus is the best and that's really all there is to say on the matter.
oh please.
i will have you know, miss fancy computer dork...
that i DID upgrade my computer.
yes, you are talking to the proud owner of a brand new BILL COSBY COMPUTER, ok?
it is a stylish laptop in the shape of none other than bill cosby, the comedy LEGEND himself.
he is looking a little sly, and fatherly, and he is wearing a sweater, and he is bill cosby.
i made it with my alchemiter.
then you will just have to make lots of NEW awesome stuff!
ok hold that thought, im going to yank this stupid monster off of the thing.
_
132. JH13: =004789
augh!!!!!!!!!!!
i am making such a fucking mess in here.
_
133. JH14: =004790
oh, nothing.
i am just dropping monsters all over the place, that is all.
are you upstairs?
ok, good.
i left the cruxite by the lathe, as well as the punched card with the green thingy on it.
you should have plenty of time to make it. no drama here!
a little more than 6 minutes.
in the meantime, i will try to contact rose and get this prototyping nonsense sorted out.
it's so confusing...
in my foolishness, i came very close to prototyping your grandpa.
we very nearly had to face our grandfatherly paradox-dad as a last boss.
that would probably be the worst case scenario.
_
134. RL49: =004804
rose, i have a question, and i am in a hurry!
so hurry up and answer!!!
oh.
it is?
ok, haha, that's a confusing thing you said, but that topic will have to wait!
jade is minutes away from entering, and i need to decide what to do with this kernel sprite.
i really don't want to mess up and do something stupid.
i was thinking about not prototyping at all, to not give the monsters any new powers.
what do you think, rose?
i thought i'd ask since you seem to know all the mysteries.
yes.
that is exactly what i was going to say.
um...
ok?
bluhhhhhh...
rose, tick tick tick!!!
oh, wow.
you mean like when i died in another dimension, because terezi hornswoggled me?
what's not?
oh, ok, i see.
well, uh...
is there anything you can tell me?
what?
oh no!
then i guess i will not do that.
why is it so bad?
but...
i thought you said it wasn't going to be able to make a universe anyway?
wasn't it barren or something?
so why is it important?
OHHHHHH.
why didn't you say so, of course the answer is treasure.
what is the treasure, exactly?
what sound?
aaaahh!
yeah, i've got to go. we can chat about treasure later.
anyway, i will sort out this prototyping silliness myself.
thanks rose!
_
135. RL50: =004821
blaaauuuuuuuuugh, what happened!!!!!
yes, i know!
on the corner of my ghost bed!
in the middle of an oil ocean!
for some reason!!!
um...
i have no idea.
i don't remember what happened, i was in the middle of helping jade...
and then...
i guess my bed crashed?
and i got knocked out i guess.
i was dreaming.
i couldn't have been out for that long, because my dream was really short.
i was on the battlefield again.
but i did not have time to seek the treasure!
but...
i did see a black guy wrapped up in my ghosty bed sheets.
he was acting very suspicious.
oh...
i do not mean like, an african american or anything.
like bill cosby.
r.i.p. bill. :(
this fellow had a hard black shell, like all the dead guys do.
i followed him for a bit...
and then some sorta ruckus transpired, and i woke up.
and now jade won't answer!
do you know if she's ok?
i'm not?
oh yeah...
that didn't by any chance stop being a thing that was true, did it?
fuck!!!
rose, this is all oil! it'll all just explode any second, won't it???
fuuuuuuuuuuuck!!!!!!!
_
136. RL51: =004822
ok, thank you rose.
hey, how do you know these things anyway?
can you see me somehow?
oh man, really?
like a magic one?
can it show you the future?
is that how you know what's going to hpapen?
like what?
durrrrr.
oh... yeah.
point taken. i guess i should be looking, huh?
okay, so...
with what you've learned from your dreams and gods and magic and stuff...
do you have it all mapped out now? do you know everything?
yeah, but...
neither did i!
oh yeah.
ok, buuuuuut...
i guess that's not all i'm talking about.
you seem a little different.
kind of, um... spooky?
i just mean that before, it felt like we were in this adventure together, figuring stuff out as we went along.
and now you have all the answers! because of magic, and other mysterious reasons!
and you want to use your powers to break the game, and i still don't really understand why, and...
bluh.
oh, yeah, you're right..
i guess i just started worryin'...
that you are getting away from us!
because you know everything, and you're magic, and you have a crystal ball, and a salamander, and you are basically a wizard.
and that's cool, and it sure does sound fun...
but i kinda think it was more fun when you just did things like read books, and tell jokes.
BA-DUM PSHHH!
sorry. :(
_
137. RL52: =004823
well, if you do not have any objection...
maybe later, i will drop by your planet again and rescue you, thus breaking the spooky spell put on you by your nefarious, shadowy masters.
that way you will stop being so grimdark and ominous, and basically completely off the deep end in every way, as is now painfully obvious to anyone with a brain.
yes.
please write some happy stories in your journal, about lively horses, and conspicuously not about wizards, or sadness.
yes, this is good.
you see rose, these are jokes.
this are what they look like, do not be alarmed.
laughs, rose. laaaughs.
also, those crescenty looking holes where laughs come out of?
those are smiles!
observe... :D
ok, i will wait patiently.
no, rose!
that sort of nonsense is exactly what is out of the question!
i see things are more urgent than i realized.
i will have to venture there straightaway, and slap you right out of that silly old trance!
oh.
well shit.
oh yeah.
what is this treasure, anyway?
and how's it gonna save us!
tell me anyway!
...
you're right, that is the shittiest sounding treasure i have ever heard.
_
138. RL53: =004824
so what is this tumor supposed to do?
and what is the significance of...
removing it, i guess?
does that mean im curing the battlefield or something?
like the planet's doctor?
hello?????
rose?????????????
by what?
????????????????????????????????
i will?
um...
which ones are those?
uh... karkat and vriska?
oh god, i was right. there they are now.
how did you know?
wait!!!
there's stuff you didn't tell me!
what happened with jade? did i mess anything up with the prototyping??
aaaugh, why can't i remember!!!!!
don't go yet rose, tell me!
rose???????
BLUH BLUH
HUGE WITCH
_
139. KV11: =004825
karkat!!!!!!!!!!
hey, shut up a second!
i need you to be nice for a change and do me a favor...
have you talked to jade recently?
can you tell me what happened to her??
uh...
hmm.
jade is the girl who i am pretty sure just entered our session.
she is my client player.
um, yeah... i thought you knew that? you talked to her a bunch of times, apparently.
oh!
ok, i see what is going on here.
we are finally getting to our first couple of conversations. cool!
so... the smell is from a foot... but also from funeral flowers?
this metaphor is confusing.
yeah, i know!
this is all that big time trolling i was looking forward to.
and it's pretty good so far, and ordinarily i would be excited to hear more...
but i really am concerned about what happened with jade!
my request for a favor still stands, even though this is early you, and you still think you hate me.
ok, fine! you hate me sooooo much, like, for real.
can you just tell me what's up with jade?
can you see her?
can you tell me what happened? what did she do that was so bad?
ok!!! i'm an idiot! can you just tell me anyway????
whoa...
the ground is shaking...
what's going on?
so tell me what i fucking did!!!
yes!
please, no more stalling or "i already told you's" or any other maddening nonsense!
just...
TELL ME!
:|
_
140. KV12: =004834
jade prototyped a lusus?
what's that?
oh, you mean her dog!
so, she prototyped becquerel?
why is that so bad?
_
141. KV13: =004835
what properties?
uh oh...
_
142. KV14: =004837
huh...
yeah, it kind of does.
i'm sorry karkat, i didn't realize we screwed up so bad.
_
143. KV15: =004838
oh, yeah, i know.
you're really gonna tear me apart!
i just feel kind of bad i fell asleep, i don't know what came over me.
maybe i ate too much lasagna.
_
144. KV16: =004839
who?
betrayed?
um, ok.
_
145. KV17: =004840
er...
not really.
_
146. KV18: =004841
i suppose it was...
but meh, it is all water under the bridge.
which is where trolls and their shenanigans belong!
oh, there will be lots of great material. just wait until i start handing out rabbits, you will love that.
yeah, i should get going too.
my friend is pestering me, and i doubt she likes to be kept waiting.
(she is sort of the bossy type!)
ummm...
yeah, you're right, it is probably of no significance to you whatsoever.
(hehehehe)
_
147. VS16: =004874
hey vriska, sorry to keep you waiting!
yeah, i know.
um, sorry to cut this short, but this isn't really the best time to chat!
i am in the middle of an ocean of oil that is ablaze with a lot of green fire.
i need to figure out a way to escape!
unfortunately, i fell asleep for some reason, and my bed landed here.
i can't believe i was so stupid.
you were?
um...
you can do that?
hmm.
what do you mean, "limit"?
are you saying you can usually do more than that?
ok, that is pretty cool i guess...
but...
why???
why would you put me to sleep and put me in this predicament?
ok, but...
i kind of get that, but it's also kind of odd...
if you're seeing my future, and you know those things are the outcome, then why are you going back and...
i guess, involving yourself with these events? see what i mean?
ok, that...
SORT OF makes sense, i guess.
but it's kind of hurting my head to think about!
ah HA!
so you did watch that video I sent.
what did you think?
_
148. VS17: =004875
yessssssss, i knew it!
no, it would look so stupid!
i thought you didn't want to get sidetracked!!!
anyway, putting me to sleep and landing me in hot water is one thing...
but you sort of indirectly caused a MUCH BIGGER problem!
before i fell asleep, i was about to prototype something really ridiculous to make jack weaker.
i am pretty sure that it would have made jack lose both eyes, both arms, and give him silly blue hair, and possibly also make him be a girl?
he probably would have been pretty easy to beat!!!
but instead, it was prototyped by jade's first guardian dog lusus.
and now he is unstoppable!
and he becomes the one who is stirrin' up all that trouble in your session too!
i mean, it sounds like your intentions were good, but you probably didn't realize to what extent you were messing everything up!
what????????
vriska, why would you do that!
but!
no!
why should i calm down when you just said you deliberately sabotaged all of us?
but what does that mean!
i don't know if that makes sense!
i mean, it kind of does...
but something doesn't really add up about it.
if you knew he was going to be created regardless of what anyone did...
why did you decide to involve yourself that way?
like the way you are involving yourself with me becoming a hero or whatever?
augh!
BUT WHYYYYYYYY!
_
149. VS18: =004876
that is the dumbest thing i have ever heard.
i am not bitter! i just think your plan is dumb.
if he is as strong as karkat says, he will probably kill you!
er...
is luck actually a real thing?
you sound pretty cocky! you should be careful about that, that is totally how people have bigtime downfalls.
especially when they act kind of nefarious!!!
wow, uh...
i am not sure who would make me more nervous, you or jack.
you really think we will meet?
so...
um, if we meet...
are you going to...
uh.
like,
when you see me,
karkat said that...
you might...
oh jeez, i dunno.
never mind.
bluhhhhhhhh.
if you say so.
wait!
what am i about to doooooooo!
o.
there, that was a 9th o. you don't even deserve 8!!!!!!!!
whoops...
_
150. VS19: =004884
oh, hey.
who's pupa?
did what?
you mean, this windy thing here?
_
151. VS20: =004979
for what? you mean...
that windy thing? did i actually do that somehow?
oh, right! i got to the top of my echeladder somehow. i didn't even really think it had a top, or that i would get there so fast.
so i guess that's it, then! don't have to worry about leveling up anymore. that's pretty neat.
it is?
wow, really?
ok, what do i do?
that sounds pretty cool. where is it?
ok, i will! thanks a lot, vriska!
Salamanders: 1. see what?
um...
you mean... the sky?
2. you must be talking about the windy thing.
yeah, uh. sorry about that.
heheh..
3. the green tragedy? oh...
you mean the fire?
wow...
sounds like he's in for a treat!
5. hey!!!
6. hey little fella, where are your parents?
do salamanders even have parents?
oh, duh, of course they do. i guess what i mean is do you have a family or anything?
hmm, i already adopted one young salamander today. but, then i left her at my friend's house...
so i think i'll let you be. i dunno if i'm cut out to be a dad!
i mean, i don't even have a tie, or a pipe, or a really serious looking wallet or anything.
thinking about it is making me miss my dad. hey, i wonder if i'll see him when i sleep on my quest bed? i hope so.
anyway, thanks for listening. see you, little guy!
14. but... those are my bedsheets! how did you get them?
15. um... do you by any chance want me to behold your robes?
17. Sorry. Where can I get some robes to join your club?
oh. nah, not really.
i don't really feel like walking around wrapped up in a stupid bedsheet.
18. ok, jeez!!! i am beholding them as hard as i can right now, whatever that means. are you satisfied?
21. aww...
22. i've got loads of boondollars! here, i will treat you to a nice lunch.
yes, i guess having money leads to some complicated decisions. oh well, enjoy!
23. what is it?
wow, 10,000? that's a lot...
but really, i guess it's not so much, since i have millions.
hey! you can't do that.
i will pay you 10,000, and that's my final offer!
aaaauuuuugh, it was was one of dave's dumb butt puppets??? i hate these things! what a ripoff.
- i'm not doing business with you anymore, you scoundrel!
26. hmm, well, i agree it is important to keep up with the fashions.
tell you what, i will give you some money for a hat, so that you can be one of the coolest salamanders in town!
heheheh. you're welcome.
28. oh! that must be my quest bed!
er... i mean the heir's quest bed.
i almost forgot i was being all sneaky and incognito here.
_
152. VS21: =004981
ok, i think i'm ready to take this legendary nap!
and then climb the god tiers, i guess?
yeah...
maybe it is a little TOO exciting.
i am not sleepy at all!
also, this is not much of a bed. more like a really hard slab of rock.
i don't see how i will be able to sleep.
um...
you mean, you're asking me this time, instead of just doing it?
what happened to you wanting to be responsible for me becoming a hero!
well...
i'm supposed to go to sleep to realize my destiny...
and you have the ability to make me do that, so...
i don't really see the harm in that.
it sounds like it is just the practical thing to do. 
yes, that is my decision.
vriska, please put me to sleep!
_
153. JH15: =005315
hey jade, are you there? i have a computer now.
this boring guy keeps blinking at me though, and it's weird.
hi!
sorry i disappeared after you entered the game...
but from what i have seen in the clouds, it doesn't look like you have had much trouble making progress!
oh, nice!
dave is serving ALL the ladies, isn't he?
he is like a dude on butler island.
i mean, a dude who happens to be one of the butlers...
doing a lot of serving, to various ladies who are vacationing at this snooty resort.
wait, i am fucking this up.
ok, good.
all i am saying is, why can't i have a dave butler too?
thank you.
what is the equipment you're deploying?
hmm... i don't think so. not recently anyway.
he has? but i thought he "hated" you!
yes, this is what i have concluded about him as well.
he is a pretty great guy. i am really looking forward to more of his outbursts, especially his first conversation with me, which i am to understand will be legendary.
but we shouldn't tell him we said any of this, or he will be "furious"!
so what else have you been up to?
we should try to catch up as much as possible!
oh man.
you will never guess what i am doing right now.
go ahead, try to guess, you will not succeed.
oh god dammit!
_
154. JH16: =005316
how do you know!
do you have rose's crystal ball? 
argh, i am surrounded by real life witches!
everyone i know is turning magic, it's ridiculous.
including me! i'm magic now.
no, he is neither a chauffeur, nor a familiar...
he is just a new friend!
also, this is not a magic car, it is an ordinary car.
i found it in my dad's wallet.
yes, i just found his wallet on the ground.
but my dad was nowhere to be found. :(
the clouds led me to the wallet though, so maybe they will keep leading me to him?
ok.
i have seen lots of interesting things in the clouds...
i guess you used to see things like that all the time, right?
wow, uh...
well, lots of things that were mysterious and didn't make much sense...
but also lots of things i recognized.
like stuff i have done before. and also stuff i will do in the future.
and things that rose and dave have been up to...
and you too!
well, i saw you on your island, and saw you sleeping in a floating bed, and...
i saw your pretty snow planet...
and i saw you with some frogs...
have you found any frogs yet?
well, i saw you once in a neat outfit...
it was kind of like you were torn from the pages of my favorite japanese mangas.
and the snow was melting.
and you were surrounded by frogs for some reason!
heh, now it sounds like i am describing a weird dream i had about you.
which i guess is sorta true?? anyway, i guess that must not have happened yet.
dunno! but you are a witch, remember.
witches LOVE frogs.
i doubt it, it looked to me like a friendly gathering. 
oh, and one time i saw a green version of you with pointy ears, and you were crying!
did that happen yet?
oh no!
what happened? where is she now?
wow jade, you really have been up to a lot!
and i have just been staring at these dumb clouds for hours or whatever.
i even saw my own dead body in a cloud! 
_
155. JH17: =005317
it's ok though, it already happened.
i was sort of tricked into sleeping on my quest bed.
and when i went to sleep, jack killed me.
she must have known that would happen... 
vriska. do you know her? 
she is pretty cool, but just between you and me, she might be a little crazy!
but, i don't think it's really like that...
honestly i think dying was a necessary part of the process, and she just didn't tell me so i wouldn't get scared.
well... i died on the quest bed and woke up here, as my dream self.
and now i have all these sweet wind powers.
which is how i am making this car fly!
yeah! 
hmm, i have no idea! 
maybe you shouldn't rule it out though?
i mean, you did mention your dream self isn't COMPLETELY dead, remember?
heheh.
she was that bad, huh?
ok, i will not pry.
_
156. JH18: =005318
i know, right?
/rolls eyes
he is just this silly guy i met when i woke up here.
he seemed to be curious about me and followed me around for a while.
also, i noticed he was wearing my bedsheet.
i don't know, there seems to be this whole cult full of people who worship my ghost sheets.
i ran into a bunch of them in a salamander village, they are all completely ridiculous.
so i guess he is a member of the cult?
derp! they aren't idolizing ME, it's my dumb bedsheets they love!
it's so stupid.
OH!
also, another thing about him...
he has the queen's ring!
i've tried! i asked him politely for it and everything.
but he is very protective of it!
actually, i think it's ok.
i think he is supposed to keep it.
yes. once i saw something in the clouds.
it was hard to tell what was going on, but i saw him!
im pretty sure it was the future, and he had the ring, and...
and then the cloud stopped showing me.
but i am pretty sure that some day...
he will have to wear it!
so i think i will just let him keep it.
for some reason, i trust him.
yeah, trust all around!
how trustworthy do you even have to BE to CONFIDE in someone like that.
anyway, i guess that's enough of that nonsense.
i should keep looking for my dad!
maybe if i fly around in this car with this guy beeping here, the noise will get his attention and he will find me.
_
157. JH19: =005319
you did? 
oh! well that sure is convenient!
where is he?
oh wow...
jade, what if they get married or something???
oh god, if rose became my sister too, that would wreak HAVOC on karkat's shipping diagram!
as leader of this team i submit that we cannot afford to let this happen!!!!!!!!!!
everyone man your battle stations!!! 
we have a ship to sink! arm torpedoes!!!!!!
KA-PCHOOOOOOOOOOOOO. target destroyed. B)
heheh, i am just joking around, of course.
:P 
yes, i agree.
even if it would make it awkward for me to marry rose.
but maybe that doesn't matter? these are kind of special circumstances.
i wonder if my dad and her mom would mind us getting married...
whoa, in love??? 
oh jeez, yeah i guess you're right. 
um... 
er. 
argh!
this line of questioning is making me flustered.
all i know is, i was ordered by karkat to marry rose.
i think we can both agree that it would be reckless to look at a crappy shipping diagram made by an alien, and ignore its message altogether.
it's a thing of beauty, and it will save the human race.
yes.
btw, you will marry dave.
100% TRUE REALITY.
it's ok though, i will not press you on your feelings for him.
i already know you are totally into the strider anyway. 
it's all in the diagram, jade.
it's all in the diagram. 
that you do.
ok but anyway, who cares about his terrible shitty drawings and meddlesome romantic schemes!
how do i find my dad!
bluh!!! 
yes, that's a good idea, i'll do that.
thanks for the help, jade! 
i will talk to you later. 
_
158. KV19: =005320
karkat!
what's up? 
know what?
uh... 
oh no!
are you in some sort of trouble?
is it jack?
karkat???
what's going on?
_
159. KV20: =005322
karkat!!!
hey buddy, you were making me worried there...
are you ok?
errr... 
oh god, this is not right!
you aren't supposed to hate me anymore, you're supposed to be kinda my friend, sorta!
when is this? 
ok, duh! i know that.
i mean, how many times have you talked to me before?
AUGH!
this isn't good, i need to talk to future you!
because it sounds like you're in trouble.
i think maybe you are running from jack?
no, i know, but...
*SIGN* 
ultimate riddle shit? 
no, i just want to talk to future you. :( 
_
160. VS22: =005366
oh, hey there, vriska.
can this wait? i was about to check out this castle and see if my dad is here.
oh...
dang it!
do you know where they are?
argh, how much later??
well...
ok, i guess so.
shrug.
pshhh.
i don't know if it is much of a major accomplishment, honestly.
um... no?
i guess i just miss my dad. i was hoping he would be here, but apparently i won't see him for another few hours or whatever?
if that is what you see in the future, then i guess there's no fighting it. bluh.
yeah, i know.
i guess you just have to think of them the way you think of your lusus..ses? lusi?
that...
is too bad..
no!!!
why would i be mad at you, vriska?
oh. right.
i... actually almost forgot about that!
why would you need to apologize though?
i mean, i admit i was pretty confused about it at first, seeing my dead body in the cloud and all...
but in the end, you did it to help me, didn't you?
really, i should probably be thanking you!
uh...
are you there?
heh. i really don't know what reason i would have to be angry!
i mean, aside from the deception involved, but i kinda understand why you did that.
and in any case, you did give me a choice.
shruuuuuuuug!
so...
is that what you wanted to talk to me about?
_
161. VS23: =005367
then what is it?
you did?
who was it? you mean like, a bad guy?
oh yeah, karkat mentioned that he was in trouble, and then had to go.
it made me a little worried! are you guys under attack or something?
oh.
well, then...
who did you kill?
why?
well, did he attack you or something?
uh...
why did you have to?
wow.
you're right, vriska. that does not sound good.
you don't?
what about all of your friends?
i bet karkat would listen.
or what about terezi? she's pretty nice, isn't she?
why not?
well, how do you feel?
oh...
i guess i understand. i mean, i'm trying to, with the cultural difference and all.
like, trolls are more violent and angry, right? kind of like klingons or something, which is an angry race of alien savages from a human tv show.
oh, i know, that's not what i meant! but i am guessing you all have to act tough to make it in your world, and have a sense of honor about fighting, and like to beat people up and stuff, right?
but i think that no matter what alien culture you are from, killing is still wrong!
and it sounds like you do too.
well, you could try. i am listening.
i think if you feel bad, it just means you have a conscience. which is good, right?
how was it like a test?
ok.
so...
you killed other people, that you didn't care about?
hm. how many?
or... do i want to know...
uhhhhhhhh.
hopy shit...
i guess that is why you didn't get along with her?
i see.
still, that is a LOT of killing. jesus....
but then you finally killed a guy you liked, and...
not so cool anymore?
uh.
...
i guess i had no idea how different we really were.
what i am hearing is seriously scaring the shit out of me!
ok, well i appreciate the honesty.
so... if killing isn't exactly wrong, then what is it?
what do you mean by "what killing really means"?
_
162. VS24: =005368
what does it mean?
that sounds terrible!
i would like to be culturally sensitive, but i wish it didn't have to be like that for you.
i have started to really like you guys!
:(
yeah, that's true.
hehe... yeah me too. :)
what?
uh...
i don't really see how you guys killing each other would help you play the game better! 
dead?
gosh...
your team is so crazy!
how?
huh...
yeah, i can see how that could be true.
you probably mean that as an insult, but i think it is a nice compliment!
but...
i won't tell him you said it, heheheh.
_
163. VS25: =005372
so... what about jack?
are you still planning on killing him?
that would be a constructive way to use your killer troll instincts, even by human standards.
it is much better than killing friends.
well, we have a plan to defeat him too, so there's that.
yeah.
so...
will you fight him then?
for whatever it's worth coming from a human, feeling remorse doesn't make you weak!
i bet you are still really strong.
but then, i'm not sure if i actually want to encourage you to go off fighting him...
because as strong as you probably are, it sounds like he is REALLY strong.
and even though you killed tons of people, i think i would still be pretty sad if you died.
so maybe you should just let us handle it? at least we won't fight him directly.
well, maybe you don't?
all of the luck sounds like an awful lot of luck to have.
heh.
what?
_
164. VS26: =005373
yes.
like.... ancestors?
wow, that is kinda neat.
so, do you believe?
all of them?
hehe...
how did you know she was the one?
_
165. VS27: =005374
what was in the chest!
_
166. VS28: =005375
that is a pretty exciting story!
so then, your great great great grandnanna or such was some kind of troll pirate? uh, i mean, pir8?
now that you mention that...
it really sounds like our situations are not so different!
i created our guardians in the lab too, along with the four of us.
and when you think about it...
i never even knew my nanna.
she died before i was born. or, uh, before i created myself and sent baby me back in time, i mean.
so really, she is my ancestor too! someone i am connected to genetically, but never knew.
and even though i never knew her, she definitely helped me when i was growing up!
i followed in her footsteps, and became an incredible prankster.
i even had a book i learned a lot from too, the book was sort of a family tradition.
it was written by an even older ancestor, my nanna's grandpa, who was only the most LEGENDARY PRANKSTER OF ALL TIME.
so as you can see, we have both benefited greatly from ancestral wisdom.
i think it is nice to see that when you take a closer look, we have a lot more in common than we first thought.
what?
heheheh, yep! also, her ashes were there too.
yeah, it is pretty great, actually. i highly recommend being human.
_
167. VS29: =005393
ok then, i guess i will get going.
to keep looking for my dad!
um...
are you saying that i am not supposed to find him yet?
well, yeah.
but what responsibility do you mean?
ok.
so you're saying i should go get the tumor now instead of putting it off?
wait, i mean the tumor.
wait...
i mean The Tumor!
yeah.
which is what i was wondering about...
how am i supposed to get it out?
i guess go find a cave or something?
what...
uh, is that even possible?
hehe, no.
well, maybe some places, but most cars stay on the ground, because science fiction hasn't happened yet.
yes, but...
all i can do is make a lot of wind blow around!
how is that going to help?
alright, i will try.
_
168. VS30: =005394
oh, man.
i guess if there is nothing i can say to change your mind, and it's something you really have to do, then i understand.
but, how about this...
can this not be the last time we talk before you go?
it would be nice to hear from you at least once before you leave to fight him.
in my future, too! none of this messaging me in the past nonsense, before i even knew you.
ok, great. i will hold you to that, vriska.
ok, i will, later!

170. VS31; KV21*: =005764
vriska, wait!
oops, hold on.
hey, are you there?
i did what you said...
but i can't tell if it worked.
hello?
you didn't fly off to fight jack yet, did you?
i hope not.
anyway, all that stuff you said sounds fun to me, i have hells of the cage flicks in my library.
i do not even care that you're an alien! you see, cage is the universal constant which unites us all.
well...
if you haven't flown away...
i will look forward to your message in the future.
it would be nice to talk, about...
all this stuff that happened.
anyway, bye.
hey!
what is???
_
171. KV22: =005765
karkat!
that was you?
where is vriska?
she what?
what whole thing?
you mean, what she wrote?
why are you snooping around her computer!
um...
what are you talking about?
well...
yeah. why?
talk about what?
_
172. KV23: =005766
alright.
like what?
what plans?
landed where?
oh, obviously.
no i'm not!
i mean, yes, i am wearing some pretty nice pajamas.
but i know lots of things, like about the tumor, which i have already recovered...
wait, i mean <color=000000>the tumor</color>
wait, fuck.
i mean...
oh screw it, you know, the big bomb, and some other stuff like that, i am totally in the loop. 
so i have to cause the scratch, huh?
hi!
_
173. KV24: =005767
aren't you going to ask me how my journey was?
it was long! and windy. but a lot of fun.
i really like flying, it's so much fun.
you... haven't tried it?
:\
wait, is that the guy who briska killed?
haha, why?
ok.
but...
is something wrong?
a while ago you talked to me and it sounded like you were in danger, and it sounds like some people died, but you never told me what happened!
then i got distracted by a lot of crazy stuff.
oh.
are you sure?
but, i'm your friend. aren't i?
well?
who is gamzee?
really? i thought terezi was your best friend.
or wait, maybe she was your girlfriend, i forget...
sorry, i don't mean to be nosy. i just want to know some things about your situation!
i am concerned.
heh, no.
i think i know how you feel.
so he killed some people... and then what?
it's ok, you can tell me.
hmm.
ok, if you say so.
oh!!!
i can't believe i almost forgot, i've been dying to know since i left the battlefield...
do you know if rose is ok?
did it work???
_
174. JE25: =005768
really??
oh, wow.
so, i guess...
it would not have worked on my dad then?
or rose's mom... :(
er...
well...
she is a very pretty lady, but that seems like a really inappropriate thing to think about, karkat.
i don't know!
i am frankly pretty upset about finding them dead in the magic castle, and i guess i was wondering aloud if something could have been done.
or at least maybe to talk about it, without angry tirades being involved.
you are being a douche!!!
wait, what am i saying, you are always a douche, hehe.
heheheheh, your dad was a crab monster?
yes.
oh, great!
how do you know it gets there?
_
175. KV26: =005769
that's cool!
it's nice to hear you are working together. i should pester jade and see what she's up too...
oh...
frog duties???
wait, which one is kanaya again?
wow, ok.
aradia?
:(
...
:(
what!!!
did she kiss him too? :O
_
176. KV27: =005770
omg, karkat. it is like your shitty shipping grid is coming true before our very eyes.
haha, remember when you made that ugly thing? 
_
177. KV28: =005771
but now they don't have dream selves left!
who ever goes will be risking their life for good, won't they?
this is unacceptable!
couldn't i do it?
i am apparently immortal, because of this god tier business, so the bomb probably would not kill me!
hmm...
maybe i could try to be not all that brave while i do it?
yeah.
i just dont want to lose anybody else is all.
oh, yeah.
she mentioned something about that. she said she prototyped her dream self?? what happened with that?
why?
...
wow.
/raises eyebrows
ok, i am putting them back down as not suggestively as possible.
what is what this is?
was...
was that another weird erotic slip of the tongue?
ok, well,
what i am getting from this, aside from the possibility that jade may or may not have kissed dog jade at some point, is that neither of them will be able to help with the bomb plan.
aren't those the really tough to kill guys?
did she kill him?
haha.
word for what?
ok, well what about this.
since she is mortal, and i am not (sort of), and i don't need to do the scratch for a while, can i go help her?
maybe she could use some protection? maybe that is what dave was just trying to do, when he temporarily died.
remember, jack is still on the loose! he has killed rose and dave once, and me twice.
sorry. :(
really?
d'aw, that's actually kinda cute.
i don't think he would be fooled. dogs have pretty good senses of smell.
_
178. KV28: =005772
what is your plan?
rendezvous with who?
jade knows so many things lately, what is even her deal?
come with you where? who are they?
through the lawn ring?
oh!!
so then, this is how we're supposed to meet. that is kind of exciting.
so, i guess you are not worried about it turning into a huge sloppy makeout fest anymore...
huh?
won't there be other players in the new session?
like, alternate universe versions of ourselves or such?
yeah... it's just kind of a weird thought.
but i guess it's sort of comforting too.
if rose or dave have to go off and die, at least i get to see them again, in a way.
even if i will only be alternate universe john to them.
maybe my dad will be alive in that session too!!!
ok. i'll do my best.
what should i do right now?
oh, man.
our "first" conversation ever? i can't wait.
thanks karkat!
_
179. AV1: =005781
auuugh!
_
180. AV2: =005782
excuse me, alien time troll, but i am TRYING to wrap a present.
really, you all have the worst timing.
nope, not going to ask how you know my name, or what i'm sending, don't care.
and one of these ugly garments is for me, also, it's not ugly, it's awesome.
uh oh, my mouse is hovering dangerously close to the block button!
it always does that when i talk to trolls, it is the dangdest thing.
oh sweet, that has been on my wish list, ranking just below a mint condition little monsters poster, starring hollywood superstar, howie mandel.
can i expect it to arrive on my next birthday??
the mandel poster, or immortality?
i see, here is where all the sick trolling begins!
you can keep your present, i am not interested.
sigh...
the other troll i just talked to was way better, if a tad grumpy, at least she was down with talking about cool movies, sort of.
that's nice. now scram, troll!
ok, you got me!
my feathers are all ruffled, and i can no longer tell my ass apart from a big orange earth vegetable!
now can you leave me alone?
that is basically the worst pickup line i have ever heard.
blurp durp bluh, more plausible alien sounding things.
weren't you leaving?
ok then...
oh.
why?
it isn't?
_
181. AV3: =005783
ok.
is this conversation over now? can i keep packing my present?
well,
i was going to block you. but then...
i didn't for some reason.
i guess i am feeling something like deja vu... maybe.
i still don't think i believe you, though.
i don't even know who you are!!!
what did you ask for?
was this after you killed me, and gave me immortality?
about what?
you mean, hanging out?
oh god, this is so ridiculous. you are just a crazy troll on the internet, and i need to get back to packing up this present for my friend! we are not going to hang out, i'm sorry.
what will that accomplish?
_
182. AV4: =005805
so.
it seems that you are, in fact, an alien. with horns and everything.
huh.
i don't know. aliens usually have big spooky eyes, don't they?
haha, you mean mac and me? yeah, even i can admit that movie was indefensible.
i can accept that you are an alien, but come on. meeting an alien who is also a GHOST in my front yard is a bit much to believe.
it is almost too awesome.
hmm...
nope.. sounds cool though.
yeah, i thought you looked pretty cold out here.
so i brought you this jacket.
_
183. AV5: =005806
hey, your clothes switched suddenly.
was that some kind of alien wardrobe warpifying technology?
such as a warpdrobe, if you will?
you look pretty cool in more normal clothes. not that your space boots and pixie outfit weren't neat.
um, i don't know about that, really.
it just seemed like the nice thing to do.
is...
is this a date?
ok, that's probably for the best.
i would probably be pretty nervous on a date with a normal girl, let alone on a...
DATE WITH AN ALIEN SPACE GHOST!!!
heheheheheheh.
well...
since i am presuming you are new to the planet...
i could show you around the place.
_
184. AV6: =005807
this is my green slime ghost pogo ride, in all its glory.
in my childhood, it was hours of fun, and hundreds of painful injuries.
nope.
um.
not... really?
humans just don't really have much use for slime, i guess.
honestly, i can't think of a single practical use for slime, other than to be gross!
anyway, this thing is kind of a death trap, and i haven't ridden it for years.
i think my dad had it installed as one of his ridiculous ways of making a man out of me.
yeah.
parents, right? haha.
anyway, that's my back yard. pretty damn boring, sorry.
i would show you inside, but i don't think my dad would take too kindly to bringing an alien inside.
or, just yet. i would need to brace him for it.
i could show you around my neighborhood, if you want.
_
185. AV7: =005808
these are my neighbors, who live in a lot of same looking houses as mine.
i never see them. i think they're all really busy people with a lot of serious business to attend to.
hey, look.
the snow is melted over here.
it's really warm suddenly. weird.
no, this is pretty unusual december weather.
guess i'll take my coat off.
i can take yours back, if you want...
_
186. AV8: =005809
there is not really much to see in this town...
but there are these lakes.
this lake here did not used to be a lake. a long time ago, before i was born, there was a factory here.
my dad says there was a huge explosion. he was walking by with my nanna when he saw it.
then a little later, my nanna died. my dad never told me how, except that it involved a big joke book.
i never knew her, which is too bad. she sounded nice.
you did?
ok!
wow, really?
hmm.
that all sounds incredible if true, but i don't have even the foggiest memory of that happening!
the tour... of earth?
_
187. AV9: =005810
what's happening?
where?
_
188. AV10: =005811
how is this happening?
is this through the advanced alien technologies?
like holograms, or teleportations?
where are we?
oh, cool.
and what's that, over there?
_
189. AV11: =005812
it's a castle!!!
you built it?
oh gosh.
so rad.
i think i know what you mean.
i feel like a long time ago, i might have given my dad the impression i really liked clowns?
and now there are clowns everywhere, his stupid collection just keeps growing and growing, and it drives me CRAZY.
heheh.
_
190. AV12: =005813

_
191. AV13: =005814
:(
_
AV14. AV14: =005815
holy shit, look at these glittering space riches!
What's with the broken eight balls?
_
193. AV15: =005816
haha, more eight balls!!!
you sure do like to smash them.
what are you wearing?
is that a rocket car stuck in the web over there?
what's that about?
there's something really familiar about that rocket...
_
194. AV16: =005817
what's happening?
are we back on earth?
it's my house again. why are we here?
i was having fun seeing your planet!
_
195. AV17: =005818
this is my dad's room.
but...
i have never been inside of it.
so why do i recognize it? 
i think...
there were some birthday presents for me in here.
but i can't recall which birthday that was.
but i'm 12!
_
196. AV18: =005819
oh yeah.
i remember this.
there were these imps all over my house, acting all rambunctious.
but... why?
it's all so hazy.
where is my dad? 
no.
sorry.
_
197. AV19: =005823
hey, look!
that's my dad.
what's he doing here?
_
198. AV20: =005824
i've missed the heck out of him.
though i'm not sure why. he should be safe at home right now.
i guess i must have lost track of him. but i don't remember how.
all i know is i have this feeling like i should run over and give him a hug.
are you a psychic alien? like the one who jodie foster met in contact, and assumed the form of her dead father to talk to her?
i see. so it is not me who is jodie foster. it's more like you are jodie, because nobody believed her when she came home and had amazing tales to tell.
except matthew mcconaughey. 
but it's ok. i will be your matt mcconaughey. 
i guess i always did, sort of.
i think i've been in denial about what's happening here.
so if this isn't my dad, then where is he?
no. not at all.
i am remembering a bunch of things, but not that.
no.
i only remember when you contacted me and said you'd kill me a little earlier.
but that was months ago.
i do remember talking to some other trolls like you.
and playing this game. it was on my 13th birthday. i was really looking forward to playing it, but it was late in the mail.
i got some presents from my dad. like this big weird clown doll that i didn't like much.
and some fruit gushers...
oh yeah! i also realized gushers were made by betty crocker. that freaked me the fuck out!
did YOU realize betty crocker makes gushers??
well she does. her villainy knows no bounds.
oh.
he also gave me this suit, which i remember wearing for a while.
but it didn't look quite like this.
it had a black tie, and no ghost, so i improved it.
actually...
i remember dying in a suit.
but
his was not the suit i was wearing when i died.
_
199. AV21: =005825
this was.
_
200. AV22: =005849
i remember now.
i was tricked by a troll into flying up to the last gate, using this rocket pack.
she said i could take a shortcut and go kill my denizen while he was sleeping.
it...
did not quite work out that way.
i don't know. she didn't tell me her name.
she was a blind troll. she made me this incredibly shitty map for me to follow!
she tricked you too?
wow. that's pretty cold blooded!
why not?
hmm...
so i guess you never got around to giving me immortality like you said? or killing me, for that matter.
sounds like the blind troll beat you to it.
explain what?
so...
now it is a date?
nope.
no, i get that.
if i had decided not to take the shortcut, i would have lived. and then you would have talked to me a lot?
well, i might not have figured that out, if not for...
some things that just happened.
sorry... not sure what to tell you!
well, you did just show me around your planet. which was really cool!
... there's compromising stuff?
i guess not.
but who says we can't get to know each other again? 
no way! not if you wouldn't.
you said the name of the blind troll who killed us, but you have not told me yours yet.
no.
nice to meet you, vriska.
i am john! even though you knew that..
so now what do we do? aside from be dead for probably ever.
_
201. AV23: =005850
well, like i said, i flew up to the last gate. like this.
oh, nice boots!
_
202. AV24: =005851
it brought me inside the palace.
it was huge, and it took a long time to explore. it was eerily empty too.
i had that weird feeling of getting to a place in a video game you are not supposed to be yet, because you don't have the right powerups and such.
you know what i mean?
oh, ok.
so, i started getting crazy nervous the longer i was down here, and i was starting to wonder if my silly iron pogo hammer would even do any damage against the monster.
what?
excuse me, it is called the wrinkle fucker, and it is totally amazing.
that's so absurd, like anything like that would ever even happen!!!
_
203. AV25: =005852
i found it very deep in the palace dungeon. i was wandering for hours, following a horrible sound through the pipes.
i could tell typheus was really close, because it was very loud here. it could only be the sound of him sleeping.
i was so tempted to play it, but i didn't dare risk waking him up!
pretty much by then i was sweating bullets at the thought of confronting him.
yeah...
i guess if i ever see her, i should thank her too.
because this was important.
well, yes. but not just that.
the whole ruse was important!
if i didn't make the decision to go, then dave would not be able to go back in time and fix things.
in fact, if i didn't die here in this palace, we never would have been born in the first place!
this way...
_
204. AV26: =005853
nooope.
he was wide awake when i found him. i practically crapped my pants!
what was your denizen like?
what do you mean, tricky?
did she talk to you?
so, is that what you all did?
kill your denizens as fast as possible, without listening to them? 
yes, so i've heard.
maybe he just talked to his denizen?
i dunno. you might be surprised!
yes!
typheus may not be pretty to look at...
but he is not a bad guy at all!

Act 6 Intermission 1
_
205. JH20: =006195
where are we?
_
206. JH21: =006196
oh, ok.
then...
we escaped the scratch?
like, we still exist and everything?
ok, just making sure..
i still felt pretty existy, but you never know..
_
207. JH22: =006197
i'm still kinda confused though.
i mean, we crashed through that giant window you magically made with witch powers to escape the scratch, so we can keep existing, right?
i see.
did you at least make it huge with witch powers?
so i guess that's what witch powers do, is make things huge?
right, like you did with all those planets.
man, spacey witch powers sound a lot more versatile than my powers, frankly.
not that i'm complaining, because wind powers are still awesome.
but anyway, that is neither here nor there!
what i'm wondering is, once we crashed through that window, weren't we supposed to like...
enter a new game session? the reset one?
and meet up with karkat, and vriska, and all the trolls, and i guess maybe also a bunch of dead trolls too??? like troll ghosts or such.
and what about your grandson? wasn't he going to be there, from the future or something? and then he would send liv tyler to me, or actually to you i guess, into the past somehow? 
wow...
hey, i wonder what the fuck ever happened to liv anyway?
last i saw her, i sent her off to give the tumor to rose and dave...
oh god, rose and dave!!! where are they now? did one of them do the suicide mission thing? and what about the other? did they get scratch'd??? 
:(
so, they blew up the sun, and now they're dead?
oh man, that's great!
i mean, i'm not sure how not blowing up the sun qualifies as a successful mission, since that was kind of the whole idea, but at this point i don't really care. i'm just happy to hear they're ok.
how do you know they're ok? or any of this stuff, really? 
ok, that sounds awesome.
and that was part of the plan i guess i understood, but...
where is this new session?
all i see here is a bunch of giant windows, and a lot of warp speed whooshy nonsense.
_
208. JH23: =006198
you mean that one way over there?
ok...
so is this place like that yellow lawn ring thing karkat was talking about? 
how is this a yellow yard?
that's a stupid name for this place!
thats not a yard.
yards are like these flat wide patches of grass, surrounded by fences and stuff.
if anything, it's more like a road. 
sure, why not!
let's all go see a big pompous wizard to solve all of our problems.
i bet rose would get a kick out of that. 
oh yeah.
and another thing...
_
209. JH24: =006199
what...
the fuck...
is that?
_
210. JH25: =006202
wait, what just happened?
it got darker, and greener....
this place is weird. when are we gonna bust through the other window, anyway?
i'm kind of antsy to get on with our adventure and meet up with everybody! 
what is it?
_
211. JH26: =006203
i see..
since we are going so fast, it should be pretty soon, right?
like a few more minutes? 
ugh.
how long?
_
212. JH27: =006204
what!!!
that is an absolutely preposterous amount of time. 
are you sure you can't make it go any faster?
i mean, not to sound too demanding, but...
didn't you say you can teleport stuff?
why not teleport us there? 
oh. well that sucks.
why not?
uh, ok.
that sounds...
big.
i see.
it didn't really occur to me this was all so elaborate.
like, if the green sun is at the center of a bunch of universes, like a huge solar system...
doesn't that mean it was sort of important?
maybe trying to blow it up wasn't such a great idea.
oh man, a prank??
oh. well that was quite a ruse then. that son of a bitch! 
their true mission?
what was that?
...
_
213. JH28: =006236
oh man, rose and dave have sweet god tier pajamas like us! that's so awesome.
haha, dave looks like kind of a doofus with that snug little hood.
that's true..
i still think i prefer my outfit though.
look at all those trolls...
there are so many trolls. the idea of meeting them all is kind of overwhelming.
i wonder which one is which?
i think that must have been karkat there. and that was probably his clown asshole friend he mentioned, too. 
and that was definitely terezi, with the fancy glasses.
not sure about the others... i wonder if vriska was there? 
it's nice to see rose looks better.
last time i saw her, she looked really grim.
and also, dark.
i was trying to talk to her, but she sounded like a babbling monster, so i couldn't understand her.
it was really frustrating, and all of my nervous rambling probably made me sound like an idiot.
and then when i woke up later, she was dead. 
did you know...
that i had to kiss her to make her come back to life?
yes, it's true.
it's kind of weird kissing a dead body, but i didn't mind.
how did you feel about it when you kissed dave when he died? 
karkat told me.
do you think that all of our unbridled corpse smooching means karkat's silly shipping prophecy will come true? 
i mean, the guy is really angry, and says fuck like in practically every sentence.
but he does weirdly seem to know what he's talking about when it comes to romance. 
man.
i don't know.
do you?
hmm, indeed.
yeah.
there's a lot i want to tell them about.
and a lot i want to ask them. 
really?
_
214. JH29: =006237
whoa!
well, heck, why don't we do that then?
it would probably be more fun with them than being on this golden battleship by ourselves. 
oh yeah.
dammit!
but i wouldn't want to leave you here all alone for three years. 
that would suck!
_
215. JH30: =006238
:O
that's right.
that makes it seem not so boring i guess.
but still...
i would feel really bad leaving you here, even if you do have a million salamanders and chess guys to keep you company.
you are my friend and also my sorta-sister, and we just met for the first time ever a few minutes ago...
i'm not going to be like, welp! see ya in three years jade!
yeah.
now that you mention it, i'm pretty beat.
also... starving!!!
heheh.
i sure hope there are things to eat on those planets.
there were a lot of weird glowing mushrooms on lowas. i dunno about those.
i seem to remember a bunch of farms on the battlefield... 
yeah, probably.
pff, hell, we could just raid all of our fridges and alchemize some tasty grub!
ok, cool.
but it would still be nice to say hi to everybody before they leave.
just to let them know how we're doing. 
like, one of the last things rose saw before she died was me dying...
i wonder if she knows i'm ok? 
yeah, probably.
then maybe i'll just hop over real fast, and give karkat a fist bump, and give dave a hard time about his hella tight little hood, and then hop back? 
aw man, really??
that's stupid.
what is with all these rules!
isn't that a contradiction though?
if there are limits to your powers, you can't exactly be OMNIpotent, can you?
more like...
semipotent.
demidogs.
heh...
can you not control the woofs?
so, the dog ears....
is that a permanent thing now, or what?
i like them.
you are like a furry now, but not really the weird kind that people on the internet like to have sex with in their imagination.

216. JH31: =006239
hey, can i at least send a message through?
like a note or something?
oh snap! ok, gotta think, quick...
what do i write on?
maybe the back of a movie poster or something?
i don't think i have one captchalogued though...
and now that i think about it, most of them were ruined by imps. :(
_
217. JH32: =006240
yes, that's perfect!!!
everyone will love it, especially probably dave.
i think i need something to fold it up and put it in though.
i don't want to just like crumple it up and chuck it in there like some garbage...
_
218. JH33: =006241
i could stick it in a book i guess.
but i kind of don't want to part with any great reading material, especially since we're going on a long trip. 
ok, ok, um...
_
219. JH34: =006242
oh, yeah. i guess that'll be fine.
now, uhhh, what to write...
ok, will do.
huh?

220. DaSp3; JH35: =006243
oh fuck, it's dave sprite!!!
i forgot about him.
how've you been, buddy?
_
221. DaSp4; JH36: =006244
ok, i think this is a pretty good letter.
oh HELL no.
augh you bastard!
_
222. DaSp5; JH37: =006245
wait a minute!
i forgot, trolls hate cleaning products for some alien reason! shit, that's going to make everyone so uncomfortable.
oh well, there it goes. too late i guess.
_
223. =006272
hey everybody!
this is john. actually, it is john, jade, and dave sprite. we all contributed to the contents of this bucket! we have to make it quick because apparently you're about to go on a long journey, just like us. i'm sorry we can't be there for the big meetup. karkat, i deeply regret that i will not be present for these highly touted "TROLL/HUMAN SLOPPY MAKEOUTS", ha ha. maybe in three years, assuming you all aren't totally smooched out by then!!! (i am just kidding around, btw.) rose and dave, you both look totally sweet! i can't believe you're both god tiers now. did you know jade is too? also, she has dog ears. she looks fantastic. how cool is it that we're all god tiers? it's like we're a super hero team, or some kind of anime squad. like the sailor moons, i guess, but not as lame, or as sexy. i'm going to miss the hell out of you both for the next few years. i'm already looking forward to this new session so hard. it was a fun adventure we had today, wasn't it? i'll even miss talking to the trolls too. say hi to them for me, even though i didn't get to know many. except karkat obviously, and oh yeah, vriska too. vriska, if you read this, thanks again for all your help. i don't think i'd have made it this far if not for you! i just thought you should know that.
jade and dave sprite both say hi and send their best wishes. but now jade says i have to finish quickly! she wants me to throw this bucket and its heartfelt payload through her mysterious portal. so here i go.
see you all in 3 years!!!

224. JH38: =006629
no way! this game rules.
i just never gave it much playing time before because...
well, i guess i always had better things to do.
years ago i found it in a store on the bargain rack.
it was only a dollar! isn't that awesome?
_
225. JH39: =006630
yesss. you won't be disappointed.
um, i don't know.
i only showed it to a few people, but i guess hundreds are playing it now?
nobody is very good at it though.
i keep trying to tell the salamanders and chess guys not to cross the streams, but they keep crossing the streams!
just between you and me, i think a lot of them aren't very bright.
jade, please.
it is just something you can't do when you're a ghost buster, because it spells big trouble. everyone knows that.
_
226. JH40: =006631
you should hurry up and make a character already, so we can get started.
just any old ghost buster! as long as he looks awesome and like he means business. 
i will begin organizing our squad.
well, first we need buy an old abandoned fire station to use as a headquarters.
luckily half the city is composed of abandoned fire stations that are for sale...
this game is actually really stupid in a lot of ways, now that i think about it.
hey, shut up!
i take it back, it's great in every way. 
ok, now i have to find us a mission.
got to hire a sassy secretary...
just have to peruse this extensive palette of sarcastic red headed ladies...
ok, here is a good one.
then we wait for a phone call. this can take anywhere from ten seconds to several hours. 
but that's fine!
there's lots to do in the station to kill time.
like talk to slimer, and...
get slimed by slimer.
ok, i guess that's pretty much all there is to do.
the fire pole is strictly decorative.
are you almost finished making your character?
_
227. JH41: =006632
jade.
that is absolutely the shittiest ghost buster i have ever seen.
yes..
it is so yes way.
jade, i thought you were going to take this game seriously.
that is not a serious ghost buster. no ghost could possibly fear that thing. 
it is not possible, ghosts are known to be cruel and mischievous.
they will not want to befriend your fox man, they will only want to cover him in slime and then fly away.
i really think you should consider redesigning him. 
ok, well, if you want to turn our squad into a fucking joke, then that's your business. 
argh!
but seriously, those head swap options are for such noobs, i feel it's only fair to warn you. 
ok, fine.
you get a pass, but only because you yourself are a furry. 
what?
is someone messaging you through the game?
who is it?
dammit, jade...
oh.
don't tell him any of our strategies. he is the enemy!
um...
ok, first, tell him we have strategies. then, don't tell him them. 
oh god.
what is it now?
meh, he's alright i guess.
i give most of his jokes a passing grade. sometimes as high as a solid b+! 
that's fine, he and i keep no secrets.
oh, like him taking credit for my existence isn't so old by now!
hey, jade...
why do you still call him davesprite? 
i just call him dave.
isn't that easier? i mean, he IS dave after all... right? 
pshh, he is so not different.
dude is just a magical orange dave with wings! and also says caw sometimes. 
_
228. JH42: =006633
like what?
he still raps sometimes.
i just thought i would mention that.
trust me, it hasn't.
well, weren't you a sprite before?
how different did you feel then?
oh, right.
so...
half of you was a sprite.
do you remember what it was like being jade sprite? 
oh really?
which ones?
hmm.
i have to admit, i am a little disappointed in the dream bubble thing.
by the way you were describing it, i really thought we would dream about them on this trip more often!
i dunno.
man...
that was weeks ago, i think.
and then, when i do dream about them, it's juist kind of weird.
either i'm alone in my own memory, talking to figments of my imagination...
or i dream about someone we know. like a troll we have talked to, and i get excited.
but then it turns out they don't know who i am! it's like a version of them that died before they ever even knew us, and it's just kind of awkward.
and i still haven't seen dave or rose AT ALL.
_
229. JH43: =006634
have you?
yeah.
i'm starting to think it's not going to happen. i wonder if we're just not sleeping at the same times? 
heh. that's true.
do you think the afterlife is just fucking with us, jade?
that is so infuriating!
yeah.
oh well.
i guess it's only two more years.
_
230. JH44: =006635
what do you think they will be like by then?
do you think karkat will have driven them all insane? 
or maybe they will all be better friends with each other than they are with us.
i don't know. there ARE some pretty charming salamanders on this ship.
but you know what i mean. things have a way of changing.
like, have you thought at all about what it's going to be like when you see dave again?
i mean, after the way things are going with you and dave sprite? 
jade, please.
*sigh*
you are not fooling anyone with your coy shenanigans.
nothing!! do you really think he would talk about any of that with me?
there are just some obvious conclusions a guy is going to make about stuff. 
hm.
alright, fair enough.
huh?
ah HA! so you HAVE thought about it!
yes. yes i did.
i have no idea. we would probably never find out one way or the other, regardless. 
what about me even?
_
231. JH45: =006636
yes.
what is your point!
oh man.
jade, listen.
at this point i could not give less of a rat's ass about romancey stuff!
i would rather just play some games, and chill out for several years on this magical flying boat. is that too much to ask?
when i catch up with our buddies, i'm sure i will give rose a nice, FRIENDLY hug.
whereas i will offer dave a tender bro embrace, and shove karkat down a flight of friendship stairs.
but that is IT.
it's all very complicated and bothersome, jade.
you know. matters of the heart.
ok, you may laugh at my choice of words, but it is true.
it's really befuddling and distracting when you are on a major quest to make universes out of frogs. who even needs it?
like...
you remember that troll girl who was sort of into me?
well, ok.
that seemed like a pretty big deal at the time!
it really seemed like she liked me, but also, she was *probably* insane?
like, i mean, in a trollish, murderous kind of way.
but craziness notwithstanding, i didn't really know what to think.
i guess i thought she was cool at the time. i was honestly kind of flummoxed about it.
but the point is, when all was said and done, that was just some stuff that happened over one day, which was a whole year ago already.
i barely even remember what we talked about. by the time we meet up, she probably won't give a shit about me at all.
which, let's face it, is probably for the best.
.....
i think we make things more meaningful in our head when they're happening than they really are. like realistically? there were probably a lot of things that went on that day that didn't mean that much.
like remember how you said you thought karkat was getting this silly angry crush on you?
yeah.
i mean, do you really think after three years he is still going to have the rage hots for you?
i don't think even he is that crazy.
anyway, my point is, who even cares about all that?
romance and dating are dumb and boring. we are legendary heroes, and we have bigger fish to fry. like that smug fatass over there on the horizon.
he sure looks pleased with himself. just look at him, he thinks he is the undisputed king of that mountain or something.
follow me so we can seize the high ground against this hideous ocean dwelling marshmallow man, and steal all of his treasure.
_
232. JH46; JS1: =006637
jaspers, holy shit, another cake?
but there are still all these others we haven't touched.
nanna is really baking up a storm today.
jaspers, whoa, what are you doing?
jaspers, no!!!
it's fine if you want to sing me the birthday song, but for the love of god, don't MEOW it!!!!!
you're going to rile her up!
no jade, come on, PLEASE settle down.
oh my god.

233. JH47; JS2: =006638
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaauuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuugh!
_
234. MP1: =006652
hi.
which troll are you?
uh...
for a whale?
what does that mean?
oh, right.
i thought it sounded kind of... fishy!
you must be the sea troll, i heard about you.
but i'm pretty sure we never talked.
have you by any chance seen vriska around? or karkat?
_
235. MP2: =006653
um... your troll friends?
yes.
oh no...
why would you do that!
uh. what?
i'm not sure what clamscray means either. you mean go away?
what?
_
236. MP3: =006654
yes. well, it's a dream bubble.
so yeah, you are probably a ghost.
you're excited to be dead?
why?
_
237. MP4: =006655
what plan?
i dunno.
just curious about your spooky ghost plan is all.
no, we're humans.
by which i mean aliens, i guess.
i know, right? that's what i think sometimes.
it's strange combination of sci-fi things. like alien stuff is all about science, right? at least it is in movies. aliens LOVE science. but then ghosts have nothing to do with science, they belong to the supernatural realms, which have more to do with religion i guess? or about a lot of hocus pocus and superstition, maybe even magic. science rarely enters the equation, unless it's something awesome like ghost busters, which makes ghosts and stuff ALL ABOUT science, even though the ghost science is obviously a bunch of total nonsense. i guess contact mixes aliens and ghosts because jodie foster saw her ghost dad in outer space? but then, that was probably just a science projection from an alien, to make her feel less sad about her dead dad, and not a real ghost or anything. i guess the lesson is that science and aliens teach us that ghosts and religion are fake? although, it turns out ghosts and aliens are actually real, so maybe science and religion have been lying to us all along. *shrug*
um.
yeah, sorry.
what?
ha, no, i don't even know her.
i kinda thought you knew who she was?
huh?
yeah, a little...

241. JH50: =007187
THIS MOVIE FUCKING SUCKS!!!
_
242. JH51: =007188
yeah, i know.
i mean... i thought i did.
it's been kind of a long time since i last saw it. i really remember it being a lot better than this!
but now everything just seems so cheesy and stupid.
i don't know. i'm trying to like it. i WANT to like it.
i want to feel the same magic that was there all the other times i watched it.
but i can't, because...
it's just...
not...
good. :(
but i DID take it seriously!!!
i guess maybe that's kind of the point.
i always thought all this hokey bullshit was legitimately awesome and compelling.
what was i even thinking!
well, maybe later i'll be able to rekindle some nostalgic feelings about it.
but right now, i just feel like a dope for talking this up so hard.
it's just non stop terrible action movie cliches!
_
243. JH52: =007189
look.
i love nic cage. he is basically my hero, ok?
but i'm kind of just realizing now that he is EMBARRASSINGLY BAD in this movie!
he is just doing this corny parody of a southern guy who is down on his luck, and acts "charming" with his goofy accent and stuff.
some things i used to think were so badass are just coming off as ridiculous now.
can you believe that one time we were watching this movie, when he said "put the bunny back in the box" i actually high fived my dad?
this time that line just made me roll my eyes.
there's so much crappy dialogue!
"cyrus, this is your barbecue, and it tastes good..." arrgh!
jade, please. it was a cheesy line, don't be so naive.
ok, i'm sorry. i guess in fairness to you, you have only just begun to climb the steep learning curve of this vexing and hypnotic film.
but i am no longer bound by its spell, jade.
i am fine. this MOVIE is what's crappy these days.
_
244. JH53: =007190
who even cares what we missed.
just cameron stupid poe in his idiot wife beater babbling some more southern home spun heroic nonsense.
heart of gold my ass!!!!!
everything dave ever said about this movie was right! i can't believe i used to think he was just trolling me.
the stupid junkyard scene where cyrus makes a little model out of rocks and stuff, just so he could tell the criminals to surround some army guys and shoot them... that was pointless!
and all this heavy handed scoring. oh my god. the music makes every little thing into such a federal issue!
like... oh man, SOME MINOR CHARACTERS BEING INTRODUCED IN SLOW MOTION! dun-dun dun-dun DUN DUN DUN!!!
there. now you officially know they are all badasses.
also, i somehow didn't even remember dave chappelle being in this movie. he was pointless too.
and you know the malloy guy, the dick head cop who we're supposed to hate, because of how he gives john cusack a hard time and makes asshole decisions with a helicopter?
well screw that! he wasn't so bad. so what if he was a little grumpy? he was just trying to do his job. he had one of the best lines in the movie actually, which was another thing we were supposed to hate him for.
what was it? about how cusack was probably out saving a tree and recycling his sandals or some shit? HAHAHA! now that i think about it, i fucking LOVE malloy.
i'm going to rewind it to watch that scene again...
oh, and we're supposed to be like "YEAH" when cusack wrecks malloy's awesome sports car.
but that was a nice car! john cusack shouldn't have ruined it like that for laughs.
i know *I* wasn't laughing, were you?
john cusack was such a terrible character in this movie now that i think about it. i don't really get what he added to it?
he was like the second hero... but dorkier? what did he even really do? he scampered around the junkyard for a while goofing off, and then when it was his time to shine...
HE DEMONSTRATED HIS MASTERY OVER HEAVY MACHINERY! wow, he can operate a crane! i am thrilled by the exploits of this pedantic weenie.
i guess he's actually like cage's estranged sidekick? almost like the robin that batman never realized he had.
now that i think about it, this movie was always an oddly poignant tale of bromance between cage and cusack. just two bros separated by destiny, waiting to be united.
when they finally come together to kick some ass, it is arguably more moving than when he reunites with his wife and daughter!
i wonder if i'll think that scene sucks now too? it used to move me to tears, but now i'll probably think it's so lame, i'm almost afraid to watch it. maybe i should try to leave at least SOME memories untainted.
yeah right! crazy like a fOWWW!
oh...
i guess there was a stray feather clinging to my pajamas and it just poked me in the ass.
_
245. JH54; JS3: =007191
god damn dave sprite.
that guy molts like it's going out of style.
where is he anyway?
i specifically told dave sprite several times when my party would start, because i knew he would do this.
he's already missed half the movie!
um... because that's his name?
dave sprite.
what ever.
i can't believe he's standing me up on my birthday.
maybe he doesn't want to hang out with jaspers?
jaspers, i hope you're not going to start chasing him around again when he gets here.
dude, shut up.
_
246. JH55: =007192
aw, man. really?
i knew we shouldn't have invited both him and jaspers.
that's just party planning BASICS.
oh.
then why?
what!!!
_
247. JH56: =007193
when did that happen?
no. no way.
i cannot accept this!
you and dave sprite were like the glue holding everything together on this miserable road trip!
yes, jade.
you were our rock.
come on, jade.
you and dave sprite were like... an INSTITUTION on this stupid golden battleship.
why did he break up with you?!
stuff??
what stuff.
jade, we are all going through stuff. you don't see me flying off the handle and breaking up with MY girlfriend.
that is not the point.
the point is that dave sprite is a douche.
no, he's an orange feathery douche.
_
248. JH57: =007194
why is he such a basket case? he's like regular dave, but like, aloof enigma edition.
maybe it's because he's part bird? i think becoming a bird and a sprite did something weird to him.
normal dave was so much more level headed.
i have to admit, i spend a lot of time wondering what he and rose are up to.
ehh...
maybe it's for the best he broke up with you.
well, what kind of future do you think you would have with him?
he's a sprite. like really, what even is a sprite? how long do they live? will he still be around if we win the new game we are allegedly trying to get to?
there are a lot of things we don't know.
and also...
how do things even work if you marry a sprite?
i mean...
ok, he has a ghost butt, for one thing
a GHOST BUTT, jade!
i'm just saying...
what? no, i was just....
but
_
249. JH58: =007195
ok, fine.
nothing!
no!!!
well, maybe i'm just getting a little tired of being stuck on this lame boat!
don't you think it's gotten kind of old?
oh sure, i'm sure it's GREAT for you. you get to spend your days smooching and breaking up with dave sprite and what not, and you can shrink down to any old planet you feel like, any time. whereas i have to make this whole big deal of ASKING you to shrink or unshrink me, and...
i know, but you think i want to bug you about that at the drop of a hat? when you're busy and on dates and stuff? i just happen to have respect for something called PERSONAL BOUNDARIES, jade.
and it's not like there's really anyone else to talk to, except the inscrutable chess people and a bunch of brainless consorts and an idiot cat princess. oh and also nanna, but i mean, she's my grandmother, and she's great, but a guy can only spend so much quality time with his grandmother before he starts to feel like kind of a loser whose friends are too busy to spend time with him!
and i still never visit any interesting dream bubbles, and we can't even finish our cool planet quests because the moment we broke through the window all our denizens decided to go back to sleep, and...
i guess what i'm saying is, i'm MORE than ready to get to the other window and meet our friends and other new people and stuff.
are you sure you can't make the ship go faster???
and how fast is that again?
well, can't you use your space powers and bump it up a notch?
and why can't you teleport us again?
is that why we can't go faster than light either?
ok, i mean, i know that. but this isn't really a regular place, right?
isn't the speed of light like a thousand miles a second? so what does that really mean here? are miles and seconds the same here as on earth? how does this nonsense dimension we're racing through jive with all the relativity mumbo jumbo?
no, i don't want to talk about physics! i don't know anything about the laws of physics, because they are hard and boring.
i simply would like them to behave in a way that is most convenient to ME and MY LIFE! is that really asking too much?
well, guess what? SCIENCE IS STUPID BULLSHIT!!!
no.
magic is awesome.
science blows.

256. DaSp6: =007202

I CAN'T *WAIT* TO MEET UP WITH THE REAL DAVE AGAIN. THAT WAY WE CAN ALL GO BACK TO THE AWESOME STATUS QUO OF PRETENDING YOU NEVER EXISTED IN THE FIRST PLACE!
_
259. JH65: =007205
oh he's THERE alright.
he's probably just using some sprite magic so only i can see him.
don't you see, jade? he's antagonizing ME PERSONALLY, not you. he's done with you, remember?
he already used you like a rented mule, and now he is moving on to greener pastures.
it's me.
I'M the pastures.
and now his mule is grazing all over them, while he has a good laugh.
no, you see, it's...
the mule represented, like...
i don't know, like the spirit animal of his douchey ways. or something.
augh, WHO CAAARES.
_
260. JH66: =007206
who cares about mules, or pastures, or dave sprite's stupid ephemeral sky visage.
who cares about anything!!!
who cares about my birthday, or nic cage, or this boat full of idiots.
JUST.
WHO.
CARES.
_
261. =007262
hehe...
_
262. TN1: =007283
huh?
what... the ring?
who are you?
so you found it here, like exactly where i just found it... but then instead of picking it up, you fell asleep?
sorry buddy. as the age old saying goes, you snooze, you lose.
why were you even asleep?
this is such a dumb place to fall asleep, dude.
who?
i know what it means!
no offense, but you seem like kind of a lame troll. i don't think we ever talked before, did we?
no way! it's mine bro.
i dunno. this ring is pretty sweet. the price would have to be pretty steep.
why do you want this desert ring so bad. is it magic?
i don't really feel magic wearing it...
i mean, not any more than usual.
well, i'm not giving it to you unless you have a really good reason.
_
263. TN2: =007284
that's cool. guess i will just enjoy this ring forever, as my property.
yeah right, dude. would an awful guy be wearing such a sweet, priceless ring? i don't think so!
yeah...
you sure did explain that, i guess.
oh!
you want to use it to propose to your girlfriend?
heh... that is not really what i was expecting to hear.
i thought you were just being a greedy treasure grubbing douche.
yes.
but that's a pretty good reason.
i guess i can let you have it, if it is going to result in a happy marriage.
who is the lucky lady, anyway?
who??
hey!
_
264. AV27: =007285
hey...
excuse me, but
are you...
vriska?
_
265. AV28; TN3: =007286
uh. that's alright. nice to meet you.
wait...
are you a ghost too?
so... you're dead?
ok, i'm still confused though...
sorry if i sound dumb, but dream bubbles are still kind of baffling to me.
you're, uh... "REALLY" dead?
as in, the real you? i mean... dang, what the hell am i even trying to ask here...
oh.
so when i meet up with everyone on your troll meteor in a year, that means...
you'll be...
...
well,
yeah.
it's always sad to hear a friend died. even if you find out about it from their ghost.
also, i had kind of thought that when we all arrived at the new session, that...
we were going to like... hang out. or something.
wow. what even happened out there?
what? it did?
huh??
wait, i'm with tavros here, i think we should back this up a bit.
so, my alternate reality ghost dated you?
_
266. AV29: =007287
that...
but...
vriska, this is a very bizarre and unsettling fact to me!
because...
man, i don't know, it just is!
you say we dated for a while, but like, i don't even get to remember doing that?
i think that's mostly what's weird about it.
well...
can you at least tell me what happened there? like, how did that go?
oh.
what??
what do you mean he died?
you mean... his GHOST died?
as in, he just doesn't exist at all anymore? like DEAD dead?
i don't... how does that even...
who killed him???
was it jack?
he is not old news though!
he's still as strong and menacing as ever.
i just had an awesome battle with him in this very dream bubble!
yeah. i found him skulking around a memory of my dead dad, and i got pissed off, so i really let him have it.
oh, i even used the cool hammer you helped me make. remember that?
yes.
the last time i faced him was kind of embarrassing. i let him get the drop on me, and he just stabbed me right away.
but this time i think i held my own pretty well. i even got in one good hit against him!
i gave him a solid bop on the head, and the dice roll made him wear a silly hat.
oh really?
i guess so!
yeah, he sure was. but our fight was interrupted by like... another taller, white jack dressed in rags.
well, no, it wasn't actually a jack, it was someone different altogether, who just looked like him. with wings and a sword and everything.
i think the white jack was probably a girl? i'm not sure, but that was my hunch. i didn't talk to her or anything. she looked really angry.
anyway, he seemed scared of her, so he flew away, and she chased him.
do you know who she was?
whatever jack's doing out here in dream bubble land, he seems to have his hands full with her on his tail.
but as you can see, he is FAR from out of the picture.
what guy?
who??
_
267. AV30; TN4: =007288
ultimate bad guy?
you mean like the last boss?
ok. if you say so.
i always kind of thought jack was evil and strong enough to be our main antagonist. but if you say there is someone even stronger and more evil, then... wow.
haha.
i see what you mean.
you both seem a bit testy with each other. it's kind of funny.
actually it's a little hard to believe you and he are...
er...
never mind, actually.
_
268. AV31; TN5: =007289
i take it you were pretty good friends back on your planet?
um. sure?
oh, right. i remember you said you killed someone that you cared about. i guess this is him?
hmm, i feel like... maybe we got sidetracked there?
maybe you should tell me more about this english guy.
frankly, it seems like i'm usually one of the last people to learn about stuff like this, and it's starting to make me feel like a bit of a tool.
_
269. AV32; TN6: =007290
working on what?
oh yeah?
what treasure?
(stop that!)
(keep your hands to yourself.)
(no!)
(dude, you suck at whispering!)
(i changed my mind!)
(quit it!)
(shut up. i'm keeping it.)
(yeah right. like she would even say yes.)
(i don't even think she's really your girlfriend. i think you made that up!)
(you are so full of shit!)
(there's no way you're getting this ring.)
(i am going to wish as super hard as i can that i wake up with this ring.)
(it's probably magic, so i bet it makes my wish come true!)
(if i wish hard enough, that will make it slightly less impossible!)
(i think some day i will use it to propose to *MY* girlfriend. what do you think about THAT, wise guy?)
(this is pathetic.)
(stop grabbing at me! we're missing what she's saying!)
(she's going to think we're idiots, won't you STOP?)
yes!
_
270. AV33: =007292
those are all treasure maps?
_
271. AV34: =007293
um...
where?
a black piece of paper?
oh.
yes, clearly.
would that someone be you?
_
272. AV35; TN7: =007296
that is pretty neat.
so does that mean you know where the treasure is now?
encouraging it?
what, you mean like, making him mad so he breaks more... uh...
nothingness?
so that means you have to piss him off i guess.
i am guessing you have an idea what that might be?
so the bait is really you.
ok. how do you know he'll go for it? i mean, how will he actually know you're "looking" for her?
that sounds... optimistic?
heh.
_
273. AV36; TN8: =007297
well...
cool!
that was actually a very interesting story, vriska.
you're a pretty good story teller!
oh yeah?
that's... one way of looking at it.
i don't know about excessive minutia or brain peace, but i was hanging on every word!
i wish i could hang out with you longer and maybe even help you with your treasure hunt.
but i just know i'm gonna be waking up soon.
darn. who even knows how long it will be before we meet again in another bubble?
_
274. MINISTRIFE: =007327

no, please put the pokey thing down!

alright.
_
276. AV38: =007853
yeah...
actually hasn't it been exactly a year?
i think it was my birthday last time we met too, heh.
you mean the big treasure hunt, with all those black maps?
uh... mention what, exactly?
_
277. TN9; AV39; ArSe1: =007854
by the way, hi tavros.
how have you been?
cool pirate outfit you have there.
i wasn't going to.
no argument here!
what about the rest of your crew?
i remember her, the punky one who always likes to stab me with her spear...
but i really hope she doesn't do that this time.
but i don't know the one who looks kind of like your sister.
what is your name?
hi.
and what about those two over there?
_
278. AM1; AV40; SC1: =007855
hey. are you alive?
your eyes do not look spooky and ghostly.
your history? what happened?
wait, that's a rude question. sorry.
jeez, why does everyone always die so much?
what about you... why do you have double eye patches?
half dead?
who's eridan?
um, alright. but i don't think i quite followed all of that.
what does being half dead mean?
_
279. AV41: =007856
and what about all those ships up ahead?
are they part of the treasure hunt too?
isn't an army on boats usually called a navy?
who's in the army?
_
280. AV42: =007857
you mean fighting lord english?
wait, you're mind controlling all those ghosts?
yeah, but...
isn't that still kind of, um...
dickish?
how do you mind control so many ghosts at once?
isn't that kind of hard?
she is?
uh.
(god, trolls are so weird.)
_
281. TN10; MP6: =007858
hey!
you snitch.
what?
_
282. ArSe2: =007859
oh.
sorry.
_
283. ArSe3: =007860
ok.
what's the story about?
_
284. ArSe4: =007861
there was a very mysterious race called cherubs.
_
285. MP7; AV43; ArSe5: =007879
wait...
does that mean when you're a ghost you still have to pee?
that's so weird.
am i the only one who thinks that's weird?
but weren't you already pretty used to peeing when you were alive?
this is kind of a stupid conversation.
can we hear more about the snakes and whatnot? it was a pretty cool story.
_
286. ArSe6: =007882
the heroine story ends and the villain story begins.
i think...
_
287. ArSe7: =007906
wait.
leprechauns??
...
_
288. AM2: =007926
hey.
aradia, was it?
can i ask you something?
you seem reasonable, and pretty nice.
so i'm wondering.
how do you feel about all this?
about what vriska and her pirate buddies are doing.
no, i know.
of course it would be great to have an awesome secret weapon, whatever it is.
i mean...
how do you feel about the way they've been searching for it?
by using all your ghost clone friends as bait.
and getting the bad guy to blow them all up to reveal the way to the treasure?
ok, yes.
let's assume it was the only way to find it. granted.
but i mean, does that really make it the right way to beat him?
well, how do you feel about it?
most of the other pirates seem cool with it, so i'm wondering if you feel differently.
um...
sort of.
but i didn't know what you were all doing yet.
yeah, but...
i'm just hanging out here cause i'm asleep! what else was i going to do?
_
289. AM3: =007927
ok, but what about your friends!
don't you care about them?
then why do you seem so...
cheerful?
when so many of them are getting zapped by lasers.
kinda!
...
i'm sorry, maybe i spaced out through some of that.
but i'm still not sure what you're talking about.
maybe you could just simplify it for me.
are you a good guy or a bad guy?
dammit.
ok, could you just... maybe...
give me an idea of what it is you actually want out of all this?
_
290. AM4: =007930
oh my god, you are all so insane!
_
291. AV44; ArSe8; AM5: =007931
oh holy shit another story? i'm there!!!
sorry aradia, i'd love to keep chatting, but you heard the lady. it's story time again.
_
292. ArSe9: =007932
ok. what's this one about?
ogre sex, or salamander shipping, or something? 
_
293. AV45: =007935
what's the matter?
_
294. AV46: =007947
hey, vriska.
actually...
you know that ring?
i have it now.
no, i mean, not on me.
i guess i wasn't wearing it when i fell asleep.
it seems to have the power to come with me in and out of my dreams, as long as i'm wearing it.
that's how i got it in the first place. i had it on when i woke up.
i don't know.
i guess...
i liked it, and i just wanted to hang on to it for some reason.
but i didn't know i would wake up with it.
yeah...
maybe.
_
295. AV47: =007948
i'll think about it.
well, yeah.
it sounds like an important item, so deciding what to do with it is kind of a big responsibility.
it's supposed to bring ghosts back to life, but we don't know how it works.
what if it only keeps you alive as long as you're wearing it?
that would mean only one ghost could come back.
but there are a lot of ghosts!
i'm just not sure what to do yet.
yeah, well frankly, i don't give a shit about the orange guy!
the ring is mine for now, so i'm the one who has to figure out what to do with it.
speaking of waking up, it's probably time i got going too.
i'm not trying to join the mutiny or anything, but i do have friends waiting for me out there.
uh...
it's fine. we can stay friends.
i don't really like to make enemies with people, even if they're...
umm.
_
296. AV48: =007949
vriska, i have to be honest. years ago when we first talked, it was a lot of fun to get to know you.
and i admit i thought about you a lot since then.
but i guess i never quite realized how little i actually understood you.
during this crazy treasure quest, i tried to reserve judgment, like maybe it was just a troll thing i didn't get.
but seeing how those other guys felt about it, i think it's more complicated than that.
obviously not all trolls are like you.
and i know i'm not.
maybe this was all for a good cause, but it still felt like a pretty fucked up way to go about it.
and...
all i'm saying is, i'm ready to go. i've seen enough, and i miss my friends.
i'll think about what to do with the ring, but honestly...
again, i am just keeping it real!
but if i am really thinking hard about who i should bring back to life...
i dunno if my conscience can justify bringing back someone so...
dangerous.
_
297. AV49: =007950
you don't?
...
huh?
oh. right.
i guess i'll just be...
wh...
what?
oh.
sure.
i guess i'll go a little further and check out the treasure.
heh, you're right. it would be dumb not to.
_
298. MP8: =007967
me?
_
299. MP9: =007968
what?
we do?
...
ok.
i see.
what's that?
_
300. MP10: =007969
hmm.
alright. then i guess that settles that.
then, uh...
don't?
yes.
my friends mean a lot to me too.
_
301. MP11: =007970
uh, no?
_
302. MP12: =007971
ok, jeez!
i promise no matter what, i won't let you have the ring!
i'll hide it or something. or better yet, i'll just give it to someone else before you get the chance to steal it.
how does that sound?
_
303. AV50: =007973
hang on, i'm coming!!!
_
304. AV51: =007974
so the treasure's in that chest?
are you gonna tell us more about it yet?
_
305. ArSe10: =007982
(who's she talking to?)
_
306. AV52: =007988
...
_
307. AV53: =007992
ok, i'm not sure what that crazy outburst was about.
i think i'll just let that one go.
but you say this little house thing is intangible? 
so i can't touch it?
what happens if i try?
_
308. AV54: =007993
i'm not too worried.
this is just my dream hologram self, or some nonsense.
how many times has meenah stabbed me with her fork?
and i always wake up fine!
_
309. AV55: =007995
ouch!
_
310. AV56: =008008

what's so funny?
_
324. DS23: =008215
what were you looking at there...
hey, are you crying?
...
heh, yeah.
can i see?
yes.
uh oh.
dave, i have to go!
i can't hang around in one place for too long.
let's catch up later, ok?
see you buddy!

_
331. RL57: =008261
hi rose!
nice glasses.
_
332. RL58; TP11: =008262
ha ha.
ok.
yeah.
that crap is all over this session.
i'm trying to blow it away wherever i see it, but there's just so much.
nah.
i just know it's super gross!
yes!
i learned how to turn into wind and swoosh around about a year ago.
i was fighting jack and found myself in a tight spot. it was just me and him, facing each other man to man.
but he got the drop on me, and put me in one of his most dastardly choke holds! his deadly blade was poised for a lethal stab through my heart.
i thought for sure i was a goner, when suddenly i poofed away from his tentacly grasp like houdini's slippery ghost. later i rematerialized to seize the tactical advantage!
oh yeah... then i saw you. heh.
oh, hey terezi.
nice to see you again.
yes we did!
briefly, on the stone henge planet.
you all appeared out of nowhere, and we hung out for a little while.
you threatened to cut my throat for some reason, and then laughed, which was weird.
but then you said it was a joke. i didn't really get the joke, but i just kinda let it go.
a whole bunch of things happened, but nobody remembers except me.
what?
yeah.
man, you are such a weirdo.
you're almost as crazy as...
let's not go there now.
nowhere!
suffice to say, i think you and a few other trolls are total nutjobs, no offense.
i still can't believe you and dave...
uh.
actually, let's not go there either.
_
333. RL59; TP12: =008263
i dunno.
but i think it might have to do with this new power i have.
it's not a god tier power.
it's something else. something i got when i stuck my hand in a magic thing.
um, that's a long story.
one involving pirates..
i said it's a long story!
anyway, when i put my hand in the thing...
i became all... blurry.
yes.
and i kept randomly getting blurry and disappearing.
and now i think i'm sort of unstuck in existence.
like i'm not fully a part of reality anymore, or bound by the rules governing it.
man, i'm doing a terrible job explaining this.
ok, the bottom line is, now i just randomly disappear sometimes!
and i reappear somewhere else in time and space.
but it's not really like normal time travel.
at least, i don't think so.
with regular time travel, the rules are pretty strict.
either paradox space already accounted for your time traveling, and you were always supposed to do it all along...
or you messed up, and changed something you weren't supposed to. in which case you just made a bad timeline, and everyone dies or something. right?
but this isn't like that.
i'm not sure how i know, but it feels like these jumps are totally outside all those rules.
when i jump somewhere, like in the past...
i think i can actually change stuff that isn't supposed to be changed.
which makes me kinda nervous!
not really.
i mean, not intentionally.
i can't seem to control the jumps.
maybe that's for the best though.
if i could control it, and tried to use it to my advantage, i would probably just make a huge mess of things.
yeah!
ummmm...
well, we were all pretty confused at first.
you all just appeared out of nowhere, and started babbling about evil jade.
you asked me what happened, but i didn't know anything because i just got there myself, and was all alone.
but then it was cool, we all just walked around the land of hills and stone henges, or whatever it's called, and caught up a bit on the last three years.
we were trying to figure out what to do, and decided it would be a good idea to try and meet up with all the new kids.
but we had no idea where they were.
and i still don't, except i have since determined that my teen nanna is evil too.
but she is more like an evil robot than a scary wolf girl. um, but i digress.
so we were planning to make some scouting expeditions to the new planets to look for them, and everything was fine.
that is, until evil jade showed up.
she made you all disappear again, and then came after me, but i used my windy powers to evade her, which really pissed her off!
so she beat the crap out of me. :(
but then i randomly zapped away, and have been running from her ever since.
i am swishing the breeze around like crazy to throw her off my trail, but she keeps finding me.
she's so crafty!
yes, i can try.
what should i do when i find them?
heheh.
alright.
if i see your mom, is there anything you want me to tell her?
yes. i mean, your kid mom, obviously.

334. RL60: =008264

335. RL61: =008265
rose, these are some really piss poor heart felt messages.
ok, i'll find her. i promise.
wuh-oh.
looks like the jig is up.
_
336. DS24; GJ2: =008304
er.
i don't know.
whoops. sorry.
i'm SORRY!!!
jeez, it was an accident!
no, no! please don't!
i didn't mean to come here, really!
i still can't control the jumps!
i'm TRYING, but it just...
no, it's not time travel!
well, not technically.
no, i swear!
ok, see, i went on a dream quest with some troll pirates.
argh, never mind. that's the long version of the story.
ok, so i stuck my hand in this little magic house, and...
what?
i know!
i'm sorry, i would zap away again, but i don't know how!
IT'S NOT TIME TRAVEL THOUGH!
i promise! 
i dunno!
like, some kind of surreal, history altering... reality hopping... magic power.
no way, dude.
you have to trust me on this.
this isn't a doomed timeline.
i'm telling you, i can change things.
stuff that wasn't supposed to be changed.
and i'm not saying bad stuff won't happen as a result of the things i change...
but at least it won't make a doomed timeline!
the new things that happen will just be...
the stuff that's supposed to happen?
it does?
um, earth to dave.
i already said i don't have a clue what i'm doing!
what was i interrupting?
you were?
aw man, i'm sorry. i am fucking this up so bad.
see, this is what i'm worried about.
even though my random jumps are supposed to be a "safe" form of time travel, i'm still nervous that i might be ruining important events anyway.
like, there was all this crazy stuff that happened to get us here, whether it was good or bad.
and if i fumble around like this accidentally changing all that stuff, then i won't even know what's going on anymore.
maybe no one will!
that's what i'm saying!
things are complicated enough as it is!!!
ok, look...
maybe we can try to minimize my impact on the current situation.
if i fly away, do you think you can do whatever you were going to do in the first place?
do you know what you were going to do?
ok, i'm glad the mayor is alive and well.
but this is exactly what i wanted to avoid!
isn't there some way you could just...
pretend i never showed up, and let this play out the way it was supposed to?
DAMN IT!

(gotcha!!!)
_
340. JE3: =008333
stop fooling around and go find roxy, you dumb goof!
_
341. JE4: =008334
who's roxy?
OW!
_
342. RxLa2: =008350
hello?
is uh...
anyone inside that thing?
_
343. RxLa3: =008351
don't worry, i am not a villain.
i'm just passing through, looking for someone.
i was told to find a girl named roxy.
heh.
yeah, maybe.
do you know her?
really?
have you seen her??
darn.
no, that sounds really dumb.
i would rather just have some straightforward information as to her whereabouts.
can you at least tell me what she looks like?
you just what?
alright, well...
can you tell me where and when you last saw her?
oh my god.
it's you!
how could i possibly fall for such a stupid prank.
what?
yes.
how did you know that?
oh.
it seems like you have me at a disadvantage then.
which is impressive, considering you are in jail, and also in a little green pyramid thingy for some reason.
did you...
did you actually build that thing?
that's cool. it's like a little fort.
i built a fort once in my room. i made it out of a bed sheet, and some cruxite dowels.
then my friend threw it in a bottomless pit.
it was alright.
i wouldn't dare.
aren't you going to come out so i can see you?
is it working?
what are you trying to do exactly?
you made all these cubes??
that's a neat power.
i remember making some of those cubes with my alchemiter.
i think that's what a blank card makes? so yeah, they're super primitive.
but making pumpkins is pretty impressive. they're like... these big ol' vegetables.
well, if you're really having trouble...
i know a thing or two about learning to use god tier powers.
maybe i could help?
_
344. RxLa4: =008353
huh?
tricks...
i guess i don't know any actual TRICKS per se, aside from how to use some of my powers.
but i don't know if the same tricks apply to using your powers...
i said MAYBE i could!
i dunno, i was just throwing it out there.
like, maybe if i told you about some of the experiences i had when i was learning to do my windy stuff, you might have some kind of... voidey epiphany?
yes.
ok, um,
i've noticed whenever i learn to do new things with my powers, it's usually in response to something. like something important that has to be done.
so why are you trying to make this spike ball?
and how important does it feel to you?
i see.
what actually IS this spike ball, if you don't mind my asking?
then maybe the fact that you're conflicted about it is why you're having trouble?
if you think it's important to make, but don't want to give it to the bad guys, why don't you just...
break out of jail?
then you could try to make the egg at your own discretion, and use it however you think is best.
yeah. it is a tricky situation with grimbark jade on the loose, that's for sure.
but i've been managing to evade her.
i just swoosh the breeze around to hide my scent, and dissolve into wind and fly away if she finds me.
maybe you could do something like that too?
it seems to me if anyone should be able to avoid detection using their powers, it would be a void player.
get it? a void... as in, avoid?
heh.
oh.
right.
_
345. RxLa5: =008354
ok. where should i start?
you mean like when i first became a god tier?
that's a long story... i was kind of tricked into that.
it might take some setup to understand.
alright.
in that case, i guess it all started on my thirteenth birthday.
which was three years ago, by the way.
i heard about this awesome game, or at least one i thought was awesome, and i wanted to play it with my friends.
but it wasn't so easy to start. i had to get it from the mail, which meant sneaking around the house while avoiding my dad.
which was kind of stupid and childish in retrospect, but blah blah blah.

348. RxLa8: =008357
so that's...
pretty much the whole story?
i left a bunch of stuff out though.
if more important stuff that i forgot occurs to me, i will let you know.
fefeta?
wow.
i'm sorry.
i don't know, that all sounds pretty interesting to me.
sometimes in life, when you look back on things it can feel like it was all boring and uneventful.
but when you really think about it, you remember all these cool things that happened you forgot about.
anyway, if you remember more about your adventure and want to tell me some time, i would love to hear it!
_
349. RxLa9: =008358
your mom?
well, yeah. but i know her as your daughter.
but i mean, who the hell knows at this point?
there is probably something to that actually.
you were all the first batch of babies, after all.
i think you were literal copies of yourselves?
that's what it supposedly means to be a paradox clone.
oh.
i guess i kind of glossed over this stuff in my story.
but i was the one who made us all in the first place, with a weird cloning machine.
it was no big deal though. i was just messing around with a control panel, and some babies appeared.
come to think of it, we met one other time too.
but you were asleep.
you were floating around in purple pajamas, and i pushed you out of the way of a flying fork.
i almost forgot about that. but yep, that was you alright.
i might have, but the fork stabbed me in the chest, and dream killed my sleep ghost. or something.
you know how it is with dream logic.
yes, exactly.
i guess i didn't think much about it at the time, but i had a sneaky suspicion that's who you were.
you really look a lot like rose.
she is looking for you, by the way.
she told me to go find you. and i did.
so, she says hi.
uh.
she said...
she's looking forward to meeting you?
sure!
there's nothing to be nervous about though.
she's just a nice nerd who likes to read and knit.
speaking of which...
i've been wondering where he is?
i know jade's grandpa is in jail too, getting badgered by my evil nanna...
yes, sorry.
but i have not seen hide nor hair of dave's bro yet. 
hmm.
who?
yes.
oh no.
where is she?
...
you're right, that is very concerning.
who is she? would i know of her?
oh!
surprisingly, i know a LOT about that subject.
for instance, did you know they turn into gigantic snakes when they have sex?
i know. weird, right?
that's probably not very relevant to the topic at hand, though.
uh huh.
ohhh.
ok, this is starting to make sense.
i understand. she is your friend.
i would feel the same way.
wait a minute...
i've got it!
i have such a good idea that would solve your problem.
all you have to do is bring her back to life!
_
350. RxLa10: =008359
easy.
i have a magic ring!
yes!
wait. what do you mean too?
you have a magic ring??
ah.
no, mine doesn't do that.
it brings ghosts back to life!
yes wai. way.
it's back at my house.
i could go get it right now!
it is quite true.
it should be a piece of cake.
you just wear it when you go to sleep, and it comes with you in your dreams.
then you find your cherub friend, put it on her finger, and bring her back!
i think you can only use it once though. so once she's wearing it, it would be hers forever, or at least as long as she wants it.
sure.
it's no big deal, really.
for a while i was hanging on to it, thinking that i might give it to...
aw man, this is going to sound dumb.
there was a girl who i was considering giving it to, for some reason.
remember? she was the diabolical one who figured prominently in my long story.
yes, close enough.
see, she REALLY wanted that ring.
and she found out i had it, and...
honestly, i'm not sure why it even crossed my mind to give it to her?
i guess i was just used to the idea that i liked her for some reason.
at least i thought i did.
it was a stupid idea based on hardly anything. like one day of conversations.
but since i've gotten to know her better...
i don't know.
i think i might actually...
kind of hate her?
yeah, she's...
actually pretty awful!
she's so full of herself, and mean to her friends, and...
dangerous.
really, really dangerous.
yeah. it does.
anyway, i don't think i can let anyone like that have the ring.
no!
it's funny, after spending some time with a person who is legitimately crazy, it becomes easy to tell right away when someone...
isn't?
well, yeah, everyone is a little crazy. i just mean not BAD crazy.
besides, you don't even want the ring for yourself.
you want to give it to someone you care about.
that is what makes you one of the good guys.
what makes you think i'm the leader?
haha, ok. i'll take that as a compliment.
anyway, i'll go get the ring now.
yeah, that's a good plan.
if i had to guess, i'd say you must be the leader of your team squad too, right?
yeah.
but maybe we can do something about that, if we work together.
alright. off i go.
keep practicing your powers!
see you, roxy.

because as far as i may think i've come...

but not about himself.
i was the one who let everybody down.
i'm the failure.
it's me.
_
390. RxLa16: =008886
he was back there, floating near all the exploded planets.
he told me to leave him alone, so i did.
and now he's stuck somewhere inside all those shitty glitches, which just keep getting worse.
i don't know.
i have been able to clean up some glitches here and there...
but they're everywhere now.
it's like the whole universe is corrupted.
or, more than just the universe.
you know what i mean.
there's no way i can use my windy powers to blow it all away anymore.
and even if i did... then what?
everything has gotten so fucked up!
_
391. RxLa17: =008889
poor rose.
she was always too brave for her own good.
this is exactly what happened last time. 
um.
it was years ago.
when jack killed our parents.
and we tried to fight him but we weren't strong enough to face him yet.
so he killed her.
but at least that time...
i could bring her back to life.
uh...
just, like...
using a certain method.
that is not an option anymore.
that's the weird thing about this for me.
i'm sitting here, looking at my dead friend.
and it's really sad.
but at the same time...
all of this has already happened before.
the death and tragedy and stuff.
getting painted into the corner of yet another unwinnable situation.
it keeps happening.
and i don't know how to stop it!
_
392. RxLa18: =008890
but we can't give up, right?
i mean, we've all been in worse situations and gotten out of those, right?
well...
hm.
no, i guess we haven't.
i guess this like, may be quite literally the worst thing that's ever happened??
i mean, not to put too fine a point on ranking shitty things.
but this is about as unbelievably shitty as it gets.
i keep thinking about what i could have done to...
or what i STILL could do if only i...
if somehow i could learn to control this...
or like, even better understand this...
this stupid, zappy, retconny...
WHATEVER IT IS.

why not?

are those jade's shoes???
_

maybe?????

why are you wearing jade's shoes?

not jade too.
are you sure?

_
398. TP18: =008925
dammit.
well, did you actually take jade's pulse?
you know, she does like to sleep a lot.
oh.
and then...
you decided to take her shoes.
and you thought that was an appropriate thing to do...
why, exactly?
ugh, you are such a weirdo.
why are all troll girls so WEIRD?!
every single one i have met is some kind of depraved lunatic.
all the troll boys i have met are just lame weenies though.
well, except for karkat. karkat was great.
may he rest in peace :(
what?!
but, you just said...
ok! you don't need to stab me, really!
don't you think i WANT to?
we just lost everyone we cared about! of COURSE i want to go back and change things!
i just have no idea HOW!!!
EARGH, I FRIGGIN' *HATE* TROLL GIRLS!
_
399. RxLa20: =008927
what?
_
400. RxLa21: =008929
no.
well... i almost did once.
i was tricked into going to see him early.
by a blind prankstress who shall remain nameless.
but at the last minute, i was talked out of it by a pal from the future.
i wasn't ready to see him yet.
i would have died if i did.
what if i'm what?
_
401. RxLa22; TP19: =008930
i guess you have a point.
would that...
actually accomplish anything though?
uh.
more or less?
i think their purpose is a bit more mysterious than that, and i guess more, like... majestic?
i don't know!
i'm probably not the best guy to ask about denizens. jade met hers, but she's...
a sprite could explain it better than me. didn't you ever talk to your sprite about them?
you did?
wow, what kind of sprite did you even have??
er, never mind.
i did not mean to touch upon yet another sad subject.
anyway, maybe you're right, and my denizen could help me with these problems.
but at the same time...
there are SO MANY problems!
even if i learned to control my powers better, we would STILL have to deal with all this glitchy bullshit!
i could zap around and fix everything, but if it's all still garbled, how would i even know it was fixed?!
maybe you were right, roxy.
what if it's all too much to overcome this time, even for typheus?
:O
_
402. TP20: =008931
god, alright!
i was going to agree to go see him anyway!
can't a guy just think out loud a bit before making a big decision?
wow, ok.
my bad i guess???
_
403. TP21; RxLa23: =008932
fine, then i guess it's settled.
i will go to lowas and see my denizen.
but what will you guys do?
nothing?
oh.
...
i mean, even though everything in this timeline is about as shitty as it gets...
that still seems kinda sad.
i guess so.
what do you think you will do with the time you have left?
holy shit that's the saddest thing i've ever heard!
argh, why'd you even have to tell me that!
no, that sucks!
don't do that.
because it's a stupid plan for crappy idiots.
yes, laugh at my truly sick burn if you must, but everyone's getting on my case for being so defeatist, and THAT'S the best plan you can come up with?
yeah, i just think...
no matter who's going to stop existing when, if i do something proactive, then you should too!
even if only on principle.
why don't you go see your denizen too?
that's your denizen there, isn't it?
yes, i know it's a statue.
i mean, it is a depiction of her, right?
so if i'm going to see mine, why don't you go see yours too?
why not!
no, but you still have things to learn, don't you?
did you ever make that spike ball?
i dunno.
it's just a thing you were going to set your mind to, but haven't done yet.
just like i said i was going to get that magic ring so you can give it to your friend. remember that?
i haven't done that yet either.
but that doesn't mean i have to give up on that idea.
what if, after i see my denizen...
what if i could still do that?
i'm just saying, you have no idea what there is to learn from her.
maybe finding out what there is to learn is most of what there is to learn?
what if making alien spike balls is only the beginning of understanding your powers?
what if she can help you channel some sort of incredible... voidey thing?
yes, like a windy thing, but with void instead of wind.
a windy thing is obviously a bunch of damn wind blowing around!
no!
i didn't mean it that literally.
i mean, maybe something more abstract? like, i dunno...
learn to phase out of reality, and somehow preserve yourself in the void, even if i alter history...
so that maybe when the time is right, you can just... pop back into reality?
i have no idea!
i'm just saying...
who knows?
ok, yes, probably.
it just feels shitty leaving you here to have a sad funeral, and then stop existing.
le shrug my LA BUTT!
i'm not going to see my denizen unless you agree to see yours.
that is the deal, and that's final.
_
404. RxLa24: =008933
thank you.
that is all i ask.
i...
hmm.
i guess?
um.
i don't know.
probably?
yeah.
no time like the present, right?
then, um.
so hey.
if this works, and i somehow erase you from history...
i mean, this version of you...
it was nice to meet you... ?
_
405. TP22: =008934
y..... um...
_
406. RxLa25; TP23: =008936
bye!!!
heh, she didn't hear me. she was already under ground.
but yeah, i guess i will get going too.
thanks for the weird, angry pep talk, terezi! see you.
but you just said...
_
407. TP24: =008937
ok! dang.
what is it?
er.
i thought we just did that?
i'm going to see typheus.
oh yeah.
heh. good point.
i don't have one.
i mean, other than to go talk to a monster who i presume to be a giant snake, and see what happens.
do you have any ideas?
what do you think i should change, terezi?
why do you think you should know?
can't you at least try?
anything!
like, put your hands on your head, like psychics do, and just...
i dunno! try anything at all that might help me figure out what to do.
i just don't want to be zapping around time and space at random, with no rhyme or reason to what i'm trying to fix!
please terezi, just try.
i need your help.
_
408. TP25: =008939
cool!
ok.
what?
_
409. TP26: =008940
a thought?
like...
what kind of thought?
sure.
what kind of phrase?
hmm.
_
410. TP27: =008941
hmmmm.
_
411. TP28: =008942
hmmmmmmm.
_
412. TP29: =008943
ok, i got one!
_
413. TP30: =008944
there's no place like home.
_
414. TP31: =008945
i will.
_
415. TP32: =008949
what happened?
did it work?
_
416. TP33: =008952
well...
damn.
it was worth a shot, i guess.
_
417. TP34: =008953
but what will you do?
that's so shitty though!
what if you...
_
418. TP35: =008955
i guess you're right.
ok, off i go then.
_
419. TP36: =008956
if i master my powers, i guess... i'll figure something out?
don't worry terezi.
_
420blaze it. TP37: =008957
i'll make sure none of this ever happens.
_
421. RxLa26: =009002
roxy???
_
422. RxLa27: =009003
what are you doing here?
i thought you were going to see your denizen!
you did?
how did it go??
yeah?
what happened??
ok, that is a funny way of putting it, but yeah, me too!
what did ur monster say?
i mean your.
right...
what did nix say?
did she speak in the weird babbley language that you could still understand somehow, even though it made no sense?
ha ha.
yeah.
typheus pretty much did the same thing with me.
typheus was the name of my snake monster, by the way.
yes, he was awesome.
so, did nix give you some sort of challenge to overcome, which by doing so, you could get in touch with your powers?
which enabled you to appear here, by doing like this incredible voidey thing, that let you phase out of existence, and magically appear with me in this weird plane of reality?
_
423. RxLa28: =009004
huh.
you mean, like...
you just... wrapped up your conversation with her. left her lair...
and then flew to lowas?
ohh... kay?
yeah, that makes sense.
right. you mean the "choice" thing?
what were the mad stips?
yeah!
typheus gave me almost the exact same sort of choice
something about other people feeling the loss i felt, if i accepted his challenge.
which i'm sure is probably... not good?
but, i mean, what else was i going to do?
i couldn't just let things stay the way they were.
yes.
yes!
_
424. RxLa29: =009005
i'm glad it worked out like this.
iwas fully prepared to do this alone... to hop around and change things in whatever way.
and i would get to see my friends again, even if they don't remember all the same stuff i do.
which was a lonely feeling, if that makes sense?
but now i'll have someone else to remember the way things originally went.
yes. word indeed.
right.
...
no, it makes sense.
and anyway, if nothing else, everything that happened brought us here.
the stuff we're about to do, whatever it is, wouldn't be possible otherwise.
and that feels pretty important, if you ask me!
_
425. RxLa30: =009008
oh.
yeah, i guess you're right.
i didn't even notice until you just mentioned it, but yeah, i guess that dumb problem is finally busted.
thank god!
yes, that was me too.
i was playing a magic organ.
yes, see, there's this huge organ...
oh, shush. :p
anyway, this huge PIPE organ...
it let me play the breeze, so to speak.
i think that was the only way to get rid of all those clouds, and let the fire flies go home.
i guess so?
i am surprised by how my quest turned out too, to be honest.
twinkly who?
oh.
heh.
_
426. RxLa31: =009009
it's blank because it's...
nothing.
it's nothing because we are literally nowhere.
how can i tell?
i guess i just can.
why don't you ask yourself!
you're the one who asked me why it was blank in the first place.
so why did you choose the term "blank" in your question?
so owned.
you will find i am the best there is at those.
_
427. RxLa32: =009010
you mean generic objects.
yes.
not really.
you seem pretty smart to me.
yeah.
you have a funny and snappy way of talking, like dave.
but unlike that knucklehead, i sense that behind all your jokes, you are probably some kind of brainiac, like rose.
don't get me wrong, i meant knucklehead in a good way.
dave is actually the best dude, you would like him.
argh!
i mean. yes, pretty much.
honestly, it gets weird to think about all our relations in that way sometimes.
um.
i think we should just change the subject!
we were talking about blank skies and fort blocks and such.
and you thought you should know more about things like that as a void hero...
which reminds me.
do you think you are any closer to making that alien egg?
i mean, after seeing nix.
did you feel, like, a power boost or anything?
no, not like mega man.
i mean, like...
well, did she?
oh.
well that's kind of a bummer.
i hope you weren't shortchanged out of an important mystical and spiritual process of self discovery.
?
what?
yeah.
or...
wait.
what if this was part of it?
your quest?
like, to be here, and learn to use your powers better?
we are kind of in a realm of literal nothingness right now.
maybe you will be able to draw energy or inspiration from the void, or whatever?
does that make sense?
oh, sweet!
i was just grasping at straws there, but now that you agree, i'm suddenly a lot more confident in my theory.
so why don't you try it out again?
sure?
i guess there's really no hurry.
not in this place at least.
i don't think this place has any bearing on other time lines.
it's almost like...
like taking a time out from our canonical lives.
so if you wanted, you could take as much time to practice here as you need.
me too.
even though...
i'm not sure i have one anymore?
_
428. RxLa33: =009011
how'd it go?
pretty well, i'd say.
i think so.
but i haven't really tried a controlled jump yet.
i have no idea.
the thought of changing the time line is still mind boggling to me.
that's right!
i definitely wanted to go back and get the ring off my couch before i lost it.
at the very least, that way you can use it to help your friend. 
not yet.
so much has happened, it's hard to even think about.
and it's not even limited to what i've been through, either.
i've seen a lot of other crazy stuff, just from my random jumps.
like...
like the last place i was, actually.
just before i came back, to find your session in ruins.
haha. i actually got into a pretty serious fight.
with this guy.
a skull kid.
he's a huge asshole, and a horrible artist.
unfortunately.
in fact, i was in his drawings once.
it was a true nightmare come to life.
i am pretty much convinced he is the guy behind all of the problems we ever had, even though he is a complete ignoramus.
yeah, probably.
i have a feeling some day we will all have to take him down.
but...
probably when he grows up to be his adult self.
when i beat him up, he was just a teen scamp, like us.
but with a skull for a head, a robot leg, a cape which i ripped to shreds, and a pair of dumb suspenders.
meh, not particularly.
i was just really angry, and i caught him off guard drawing some shitty animes.
they were quite literally the worst animes i have ever seen.
i hope i hurt his drawing hand, and he never does any more ugly art for the rest of his stupid immortal skull monster life.
_
429. RxLa34: =009012
hmm, it just occurred to me...
aside from fixing the time line, there's another benefit to my new power.
once we all decide we're ready to fight him, i can just zap us all right to him.
we could take him by surprise again.
i really doubt he'd be able to handle us if we all clobbered him at once!
...
_
430. RxLa35: =009016
this is where dave's bro died a few years ago, probably while being heroic and cool.
jade made his body disappear to bury him, but i guess she left yea sword here.
she and dave sprite and i gathered around where he was buried and dave sprite said some stuff about him.
stuff that was really funny and rambly but also weirdly poignant...
i guess it was a bit like a funeral?
yeah
...
_
431. RxLa36: =009020
anyway...
_
432. RxLa37: =009021
you're right.
taking a break from the mayhem is nice and all.
but i should probably get going.
i have a lot of responsibility now.
i hope i can live up to it.
aw, thanks!
_
433. RxLa38: =009022
remember what i said too, about practicing voidey stuff.
good.
yeah.
cool.
what?
doing what..
haha. whoops.
yeah.
it's just as well though.
there is no need for goodbyes.
if i really can control it now, i should be able to come back here any time i want.
which means i won't be gone long!
those are salamanders.
later, roxy.
_
434. =009028
yikes!
_
435. =009031
i shouldn't mess around with that moment.
it is WAY too fundamental.
_
436. =009032
let's try this again.
_
437. =009037
wow, no.
what ever is going on here...
this is completely useless to history.
_
438. =009038
let's get it together, john.
you've got to go somewhere relevant!
try to think of something that will help target a certain point in time.
try to think about...
_
439. =009039
...one of your pals!!!
_
440. =009042
(wait a minute.)
(i remember this...)
_
441. JE5: =009043
COPY OF CONVERSATION JE1: =008318
_
442. JE6: =009044
COPY OF CONVERSATION JE2: =008319
_
443. JE7: =009047
COPY OF CONVERSATION JE3: =008333
_
444. JE8: =009048
COPY OF CONVERSATION JE4: =008334
_
445. =009049
wow, i can't believe how naive i was...
like... a day ago?
hmm.
it feels like it's been longer than that.
hard to believe!
_
446. =009050
i was so confused when that happened.
i was sure the other me knew so much more than i did at the time.
which is kind of true... but also kind of not?
like, if i traveled back here, and altered reality in a non time travely way, then why do i remember doing it?
did i just make some sort of stable retcon loop?
does that even make sense??
i think i did the right thing though, zapping my other self out of there.
it was like... a retroactively preemptive continuity adjustment.
...
retroactively preemptive???
what am i even talking about.
this power is kind of complicated...
i need to be more careful.
_
447. =009051
got to come up with a better plan than zapping to wherever my stupid whims take me.
i really could use some help with this.
but who should i ask?
dave?
he knows stuff about time travel.
but then, it's not really time travel is it.
no...
i need someone with a different kind of skill.
someone who knows how the consequences of certain actions play out.
someone like...
rose?
is that what her powers did?
i really should have taken some time to figure out what her powers did.
or maybe...
wait a minute.
WAIT!
_
448. =009052
i think i understand what she was trying to do now!
she was trying to give me a way to come back.
like, zero in on her thought signal, or something.
terezi, you're a genius!
i mean, you're a weirdo! but you're also a genius!!
_
449. =009053
alright, let's see if this works.
maybe if i just think it hard enough...
ahem.
_
450. =009054
there's no place like home...
_
451. =009055
there's no place like home!
_
452. =009056
THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE
_
453. =009057

_
454. JE9: =009071
what is going on here?
should i, uh...
should i go?
yes, me.
i mean, yes john.
wow, it's kind of weird talking to myself.
i'm not sure if i'm a very big fan of the experience?
tell me about it!
but yeah, you should get going.
terezi's experiment worked.
you'll find out all about it later.
i will?
actually, i'm not sure?
now that i changed how things happened for you, you might not get the idea to come back here like i did?
which i guess makes this situation a true paradox, unlike all those lame stable time loops dave makes.
so, what does that actually mean for me?
what am i supposed to do now?
i don't know what it means.
unfortunately, you may not be relevant anymore.
i'm the john who is learning to use his flashy powers to reconstruct the time line, so that responsibility is on my shoulders now, not yours.
sorry, i am just keeping it real!
...
well, who really knows how it will turn out.
maybe you will still have important things to do?
i don't have all the answers, i just know terezi and i have to talk now, so you should go.
where?
where you were about to go anyway!
go see typheus, and do the quest thing.
it worked out great. well, for me at least.
ok, i will.
i do hope i get to still be relevant, but i will understand if that turns out not to be the case.
that's the spirit!
_
455. TP38: =009072
so, that thing we did with the password...
we can use that trick to our advantage, right?
like what?
_
456. TP39: =009073
yeah, i know what you mean.
when i try to think of what to fix...
all i can do is look back on what i did wrong.
i never should have let that ring out of my sight.
going back and getting the ring is the first thing we should do, right?
i guess that one is kind of a no brainer.
besides, i promised roxy i'd get it.
i kind of blew it last time i told her i'd get it.
so maybe i shouldn't mess that up again, heh.
what do you think, terezi?
but other than that, the sky is the limit.
really, what do we do?
do i go back to when we were just starting to play the game, and give us some advantages?
but then, messing up our session causes this whole chain reaction...
we never would have met the trolls, or had any reason to scratch the session...
and if we didn't scratch the session, there never would have been an alternate reality where roxy and her pals got to play, thereby meeting us...
when you start looking back and realizing how interrelated everything is, it starts feeling like an overwhelming job to fix it.
on the one hand, you don't want to change so much that the reality you create is barely recognizable.
you want to keep everything as similar as possible, so you get to keep all the lessons you learned and the important experiences you had with your friends.
but on the other hand...
if you aren't going to change something substantial enough to make a real difference, why bother at all?
it's like, go big or go home, you know?
sort of a catch 22 when you think about it.
is any of this making sense?
terezi?
terezi!!
were you listening to a word i said?
_
457. TP40: =009074
augh!
come on terezi, get it together!
i was saying some really deep and insightful stuff, probably.
i bet ROXY would have thought it was cool.
uh...
what are you doing?
are you...
writing on your scarf?
in...
blood? :\
_
458. TP41: =009075
what the hell is this?
huh?
wow.
but how do you know these are the exact right things to change?
ok, jeez.
i was just curious!
...it is?
haha, ok now i know you're full of shit!
alright, why not.
_
459. TP42: =009076
this is a lot of instructions.
all these will take me to certain events in your life?
well, at least you have a plan.
who am i to say it isn't the right one?
oh snap!
terezi, did you know, even though you're a weirdo, and we probably wouldn't get along most of the time, i kind of missed you?
you were one of the first trolls i ever talked to.
we got off on a weird foot with your death threats, and jokey antagonism, and it's almost like we never stopped being on that foot?
it makes me nostalgic for simpler times...
do you remember when you made me those maps to follow?
in a way, following your instructions will be like that tom foolery all over again!
_
460. TP43: =009077
huh?
um...
_
461. TP44: =009082
why not?
_
462. TP45: =009087
god, you are so fucking weird.
_
463. =009106
might as well get started.
let's see, the first key thought is...
_
464. =009107
"R3UN1ON"?
do i have to think the numbers too?
how do i even do that?
whatever, here goes nothing.
_
465. JE10: =009111
whoa, it worked!
ha ha, i remember this!
_
466. JE11; DS25; RL62; KV35; TP46; KM3: =009112
oh man, this is great.
hey guys!
hey me!!
you're looking almost as handsome as the other me i just saw.
don't ask, it's a long story. all you need to know is we are both looking great, as usual.
_
467. JE12; DS26; RL63; KV36; TP47; KM4: =009113
dang, this was such a cool moment!
hard to believe it was only...
hours ago?
days ago?
these zappy shenanigans are making me lose track of time.
whatever, it was just a really nice surprise when you all randomly appeared on my birthday and fell on the grass!
_
468. JE13; DS27; RL64; KV37; TP48; KM5: =009114
i would love to have this sweet reunion all over again with you guys...
we had some great conversations here on this lonely stone henge planet. i really wouldn't mind listening to everything we said again word for word!
but i can't.
_
469. JE14; DS28; RL65; KV38; TP49; KM6: =009115
i don't know if this makes sense...
but when we all came together like this out of the blue, and had our long awaited reunion...
i'm not sure if we really earned it yet?
we didn't realize it at the time, but there were still a bunch of problems waiting to happen.
like, some lingering issues that were going to pull us all apart again, and make us fight to get back together once and for all.
but don't worry, i'm working to overcome all those problems right now.
that's why i'm here!
it's also why i can't hang around all day babbling like a fool. i really need to quit yapping and hit the road.
_
470. KV39; KM7: =009116
see you karkat!
i hope your pals don't take it personally, but you were always my favorite troll.
the shouty tirades you are going to have on this hilly planet are going to be epic and hilarious. i will never forget them.
kanaya, take good care of him for me, ok? thanks.
_
471. DS29: =009117
dave! see you in a different reality, buddy.
be sure to take care of mr. mayor too.
your beautiful friendship with a cute chess man is an inspiration to us all.
i hope and firmly believe it will transcend the boundaries of even the most ludicrous retcon shenanigans.
(heheheh.)
_
472. RL66; TP50: =009118
goodbye, rose. it makes me happy to see you alive and well, even if only for a minute.
i'm going to make sure i never have to watch you die again.
sorry if that sounds morbid and confusing, but... yeah.
and if you see her around, say hello to roxy for me!
haha, oh yeah. hey terezi.
i feel like this is some big joke you are in on too.
but you probably don't have the slightest clue what's going on, do you?
maybe it's better that way, heh.
anyway, the plan is going perfectly so far. ;)
(i just winked.)
_
473. JE15; DS30; RL67; KV40; TP51; KM8: =009119
so yeah, time to go get that ring.
i don't know what's going to happen to you all once i change stuff...
maybe you'll stop existing? i don't have a damn clue, to be honest.
but just so you know, you will always keep existing in my heart.
bye!
_
474. =009124
gotcha!!!
_
475. =009125
it feels good to have it back.
the dear, sweet, precious ring of ghost life...
i'll never lose track of it again!
i definitely won't let...
um...
wait, who was going to steal this ring again?
the other vriska, with the short pirate skirt... what was her name?
meh, it doesn't matter. she's probably irrelevant now.
_
476. =009131
ok, bloody scarf.
where to next?
_
477. =009132
framed, huh?
i mean... "FR4M3D".
...which i guess is pronounced the same way, but you have to yell it in terezi's weird annoying voice?
_
478. =009133
wow, that was kind of a sick burn.
maybe i should be nicer to her, since she is bailing my stupid ass out of this jam, and also she died.
ok, here i go.
_
479. =009142
so...
you wanted me to steal a stuffed dragon from your room?
how is this even the slightest bit important to the time line?
_
480. =009143
whatever.
maybe stealing this dragon is the most important thing to ever happen in the history of stupid time shenanigans?
who am i to judge.
ok, what's next...
_
481. =009148
"MOM3NT"?
wow, that sounds really nonspecific.
what moment do you mean, terezi??
way to narrow that down.
_
482. =009149
guess i'll find out. this better be good!
_
483. TP52: =009159
you don't need him.
_
484. TP53: =009161
(this is john by the way, ha ha.)
_
485. =009162
heheheheheh.
confused yet, terezi?? hahaha.
this is actually a lot of fun.
i am like the ultimate prankster now... nanna would be so proud!
it's kind of like if dr. who used his fancy phone booth to go around playing tricks on people, and that's all he did.
then maybe that show would be less lame!
also, harry anderson should be all the doctors.
wow, i should use my retcon powers to make THAT show happen! wow, yes.
it's like all of the super heroes say, with great power comes great responsibility.
_
486. =009163
hmm.
i wonder who the "him" was in terezi's note.
karkat, maybe?
man, i sure hope terezi didn't send me on a time travel quest just to fix her fucking boyfriend problems.
god DAMNIT terezi!
_
487. DrSp1: =009185
(hey, would you quit it!)
(i'm trying to keep a low profile here.)
_
488. =009200
uh, mission accomplished i guess??
well, scarf item number four, at least.
there you go, terezi. your stupid plush dragon can help with your weird "investigation", or whatever fucked up thing you're doing there.
thank god i changed that! we sure are making some awesome progress here...
not.
_
489. =009201
ok, there's just no way that change was important.
i know this stuff can be pretty subtle, but come on.
she HAS to be messing with me at this point.
with my new powers, i feel like i'm the ultimate prankster, but to be honest, i'm having a hard time figuring out who is pranking WHO here, exactly.
...
it's me, isn't it.
i'm the one getting owned, aren't i.
owned by a crazy blind girl, trolling me through time with notes written in her blood moments before she died.
but she's also kind of... trolling herself too?
damn.
i am dealing with a true professional here.
alright, enough of this asinine horse play.
let's see what the scarf of stupidity has in store for me next!
_
490. =009208
yeesh.
what a gruesome scene.
i wonder which troll this was?
she looks really cute...
it's sad that she died.
_
491. =009209
let's see... what does she want me to do here?
i'm all out of stuffed dragons, so i don't think anyone will be cracking this case any time soon.
hmm...
_
492. =009210
so i guess the clown guy did this?
i'm laughing my ass off.
it looks like he left all this bullshit littered around the body to frame vriska.
did terezi actually fall for this?
_
493. =009211
ok, this one's easy enough.
there, you're welcome terezi.
keep up the good work at solving dumb crimes.
whoops, here you come! got to go.
_
494. TP54: =009215
it was gamzee you idiot!!!
um... over
_
495. TP55: =009216
hey terezi... when you told me to say 'you don't need him', did you mean karkat or dave? maybe you shouldn't date dave either. the way you and he described it, it sounds like it got weird. i dunno, just offering some friendly dating advice! man, this caper we're doing is so crazy. anyway, later!
_
496. =009236
there.
i honked the stupid horn.
one more to go...
terezi, are we getting to the point any time soon?
i'm getting tired of all this meaningless, prankstery bullshit.
i would like to be able to say we at least TRIED to change something important here.
i'd rather not have to go back to roxy and say, sorry! your mom has to stay dead forever, because terezi decided to play some funny jokes on me for no reason, and also fix her romance problems.
it'd be nice to do something that would actually be significant enough to, you know, prevent that from happening?!
...
huh?
_
497. =009237
OOF!
_
498. =009260
uh, wow.
not sure what to expect for this one.
alright, here goes.
_
499. TP56: =009266
NOOOOOO, TEREZI!
DON'T DO IT!!!
_
500. VS58: =009268
KAPOW!!!!!
_
501. TP57: =009275
whew! that was close.
it's a long story terezi. don't worry about it.
the important thing here is, we did it. everything's going to be ok now.
um...
i'm not sure, actually.
well, i just clobbered vriska and knocked her out, like you said.
jeez, i hope i didn't punch too hard...
_
502. TP58: =009276
wow, she's really down for the count, isn't she.
i got a lot of extra punching practice in my fight with the skull jerk.
maybe i gained a bit too much man grit for my own good?
yes.
i randomly appeared and knocked vriska out cold, just like the scarf told me to.
um...
this one? 
no, no...
i mean, yeah, it was supposed to go that way originally!
but now it doesn't have to, because of like, weird retcon magic, and also your crazy mind schemes.
yes.
well, you from years in the future, just before you died.
i got help from your older, possibly wiser self. you helped me come back here, using the mysteries of the mind.
what.
shut up!
no!!
_
503. TP59: =009277
no, quit it!
hey, i had to jump through a lot of your lame prankstery hoops to get here!
plus i saved vriska from your back stabbing ways, so you don't need to do that for... whatever stupid reason you were going to?
how about a little gratitude!
look, all it says is this list of bloody passwords and instructions, most of which are dumb pranks!
yeah, i think so.
because you're a weirdo!
yeah.
i don't know!
you told me to.
probably to prevent you from fucking up your life?
yeah, pretty sure!
this is like, a fresh start. from this point on.
no! stop badgering me about the damn scarf!!!
no, it belonged to my dear departed FRIEND, her name was *future* terezi!
look, it doesn't even say anything else, i already did everything!
wait...
ok, there is one last thing i have to do.
it says i have to give you my wallet.
_
504. TP60: =009278
but...
i don't actually have my wallet?
no.
i lost it years ago.
i think i gave it to...
damn. who was it.
liv tyler, the bunny?
or was it that short chess dude.
shit!
i guess you didn't realize i lost it??
hell, even i can't remember what items we still have half the time.
terezi, just between you, me, unconscious vriska, and that dumb clown there, this adventure has been one huge mess.
hmm.
actually, it says give "her" your wallet.
did "her" mean you, or vriska?
i guess it's a moot point, since i don't have it.
let's just call it one small flaw in your otherwise mostly stupid plan, and get on with our lives.
yes it is!
or, was.
i mean, will be.
or... won't be anymore? now that we changed stuff.
um.
i dunno. maybe you need to captcha something really big?
i don't know!
it's just some vague crap you wrote on a scarf!
oh fuck.
_
505. TP61; KV41: =009279
no, i'm not doing this!
i'm not explaining the retcon shit again!
sigh.
(lmao.)
because i punched her in the face.
you heard me.
_
506. KV42: =009280
karkat, take it easy.
here, read this.
it's all on the scarf, buddy.
it's all on the scarf.
_
507. KV43: =009281
oh man.
this is turning into a stupid circus.
shh!
i should really get out of here.
the time line is already boned enough as it is without me hanging around.
i mean...
i guess it doesn't matter THAT much if i'm here?
we already changed history like... almost completely?
that was kind of the point.
vriska's not dead anymore, so that means...
wait, what does that actually mean?
so, that means i'll never be able to get the life ring from tavros...
but i already have the ring? so i guess that doesn't matter?
wait, does this really mean vriska's ghost stops existing, or...
is her ghost just going to keep existing in the dream bubbles because of "reasons"?
and if i never ended up meeting her ghost...
i guess i never stuck my hand in the house thing to get the retcon powers in the first place, so how...
god damn it.
_
508. KV44; KM9; TP62; VS58: =009282
ok guys, really, i've messed with your time line enough as it is.
sorry for clocking you, vriska, if you can hear me in your dreams. haha, you probably can't.
but hey, i guess this means i get to meet alive you soon, instead of ghost you? so that's neat.
please tell her i'm sorry for punching her in the face.
but also, she's welcome for saving her life.
i'll see you guys later. um, in three years to be precise.
bye dude!

510. DS31; KV45: =009367
HI EVERYBODY!
hey dave, not much!
hi again karkat!
haha, i only saw you like five minutes ago, but i guess that was years ago for you. dang.
you've probably been through a whole lot of silly nonsense, haven't you?
wait never mind, you don't have to answer that. there will be plenty of time to catch up!
hi to everyone else too!
oh man, i missed you all so much! even the people i don't know very well, or haven't met yet.
oh!!!
by the way, this is roxy.
she's my new friend, and we just went on a crazy adventure together, to save the time line and come find you all.
so here we are!
_
511. =009377
d'awww.
_
512. TP63: =009379
oh, hey terezi!
guess our plan worked out pretty well, huh?
this session is in MUCH better shape than the last time i saw it.
you really bailed us out!
i mean, not that... you SPECIFICALLY had anything to do with it.
you were as much the beneficiary of your future self's crafty schemes as i was.
so don't get too smug!!!
pff, ok. whatever you say.
oh, that reminds me...
i know the scarf agenda wasn't really YOUR idea per se...
but do you have any idea what all that stuffed dragon shit was about?
did that like...
actually serve a purpose in the time line?
or were you just fucking with me?
_
513. TP64; VS59: =009380
ok, wow. great.
good to know.
thanks for that, terezi. that was a really awesome use of our time.
yeah, forget it.
long story short is, i got owned, the end.
by the way, good to see you again vriska!
it's cool that you're alive now, instead of being a cunning ghost pirate.
i think your, um, *ways* probably are more valuable to have here, in the land of the living.
at least... i hope so??
don't mention it!
that's cool.
if you ever need another really important punch in the face, just let me know. i'm your man.
_
514. RL67; RxLa39: =009381
rose!
hi!!!
nice to see you, alive and well again.
not to mention in the correct time line!
yeah!!!!!
of course!
really, it is so good to see you.
i'd give you a hello hug, but you seem kinda tied up at the moment.
oh my gosh, how cute.
_
515. JaEn1; TS1: =009382
hello, um...
jake, right?
you sent me a letter once, right?
in the box full of weapons, and a rabbit?
thanks for that!
that was cool. it made me really curious to meet you.
...
what?
it's ok!
i understand, i'm shy too.
let's catch up some time, just you and me. man to man.
oh, hey tavros.
looks like... you're here too?
yeah, i know.
that's, uh... nice to know.
maybe later!
_
516. DS32; KV46: =009383
hi dave!
you're back, and alive!
all because of me.
it's okay, there's no need to thank me.
it is very dope. :)
hey karkat, don't leave me hanging here.
there is more than enough fist bump to go around for everybody.
i left it hanging there just for you, but you are leaving me high and dry here dude.
karkat, wow that is really pedantic!
and now you actually ARE leaving me hanging, in order to explain your nonsense.
i'm this close to revoking your bumping privileges!
_
517. KV47; DS33: =009384
oh, it's real buddy!
we'll see, karkat.
we'll see.
_
518. DS34: =009385
hey dave...
why is jade asleep?
and also teen nanna.
or, jane i mean.
what??
why?
can you wake them up?
!!!
right.
you think?
oh no!
man.
i had no idea.
i guess that's what typheus meant?
that's so sad...
poor jade!
i can't believe she had to spend all that time on the ship thinking i was dead...
i mean, i guess i WAS dead. but...
you know what i mean.
are you sure we can't wake her up for a second, just so she can see i'm alright?
darn.
i guess we'll have to catch up later.
hey, what about dave sprite?
noooo!
that sucks too!
you guess??
i dunno.
i'll miss him anyway, even if he isn't the "real dave".
i kinda feel bad for ever thinking of him as a less real version, actually.
yeah, that is what's important!
i guess there will be time to reflect on everything that was lost later, like dead time clones and double dead ghosts, or other such hogwash.
right now i'm still so excited to see everybody.
there's so much crazy stuff for us all to catch up on...
i don't even know where to start, it's overwhelming!
what do you mean?
ok, that sounds great!
_
519. DS35; KV48: =009387
so tell me about your ridiculous meteor journey!
the dave from the bad time line told me some funny stories when we got together on the grassy hill planet
but we weren't actually hanging out for that long, so i didn't hear much.
also, i'm MOSTLY sure vriska wasn't alive during their trip.
haha.
i think i know what you mean.
i spent some time with her when she was a ghost, and uh...
let's just say whatever her mortality status is, she makes her presence hard to ignore.
wow.
karkat, for a funny shouty guy, you backed down on that really fast.
i'm almost... a bit disappointed?
i was looking forward to more of your patented ravings!
oh. well, i'm sold.
heheh. ok?
... you are?
no?
uh...
maybe?
i dunno, it was a long time ago!
and we had a lot of ridiculous conversations...
no, i mean, i think i remember.
i think you were um, "black flirting" with me or something, but in backwards order, and while constantly yelling.
and i didn't really even know what that was.
and then i told you i wasn't a homosexual, so it was kind of a moot point, but also, you didn't even know what that was either?
dave, i think you're making karkat uncomfortable!
are you being a wise guy and trying to make us uncomfortable?
well...
not that i really want to egg on this train of thought, but i dunno if that's quite true.
i can get really angry and hate stuff too, just like you. but i think only in extreme cases?
the skull guy in suspenders i got REALLY pissed off at...
but i am a hundred percent sure that hate was platonic!
ok, dave, it definitely sounds like you're trying to own us now!
being able to hate things i think is...
the smaller part of that equation?
what about the other part? don't you think that's, uh...
a little more significant?
the part about not being a homosexual!!!
what! why?
no, that's a normal way of putting it!
i mean... it's a pretty normal thing to say, right? when that's... how... you are?
oh. kay?
so then, you're saying...
what are you saying? 
...
i,
hm.
...like?
yeah.
i dunno, it was pretty funny, sometimes.
it was just a lot of joking around!
dave, um.
all that's cool and all, and...
i think i mostly agree?
but...
ummmm, how do i put this.
are you...
are you gay now?
i dunno, it sounds to me like you're trying tell me something here!
i mean, it's ok if you're gay now!
that's totally cool, if true.
i just think...
you turning gay would be kind of a weird consequence of me changing the time line around?
ok, not "weird"...
just, unexpected!
i dunno what i did that would account for that.
maybe saving one of terezi's plush toys did some goofy homosexual butterfly effect thing on you?
jeez, who knows!
that's fine, we can talk about anything you want, any time.
i'm just still confused about what you're getting at, is all.
like, what is the bottom line here?
are you actually attracted to boys now?
do you...
um.
did you...
like, date any boys?
but there weren't even that many boys on the meteor?
well, there's the clown guy, but i don't really see you and him...
that really only leaves...
um, were you and karkat...
ARE you and karkat, like.
hmm.
_
520. DS36: =009388
dave, i'm pretty sure we're making karkat uncomfortable now.
_
521. DS37: =009389
ok.
what?? nooooo.
yeah, me neither.
um...
what the fuck is he doing?
i see.
_
522. DS38; KV49: =009390
ha ha.
i can imagine.
i think life was a lot more boring on the ship.
but we talked about you all a lot!
we would always wonder how you and rose were managing to get along with all those crazy trolls.
i think mostly we pictured a lot of arguments.
i'm still getting used to having such insane, limitless powers that let me go anywhere i want...
it's tempting to go to time periods like yours and find out what i missed.
but i don't want to mess with too much anymore, since it seems like i got the time line to a nice stable place as it is.
so i guess i just have to do what any regular guy does, and imagine fondly what it would be like if i got to travel with you guys.
i wonder if i would have gotten like... absorbed in troll culture too? or troll ways of thinking.
i wonder if i would have learned to understand black romance?
it's such a goofy idea, but it seems pretty important to trolls.
yeah.
years ago when we first met the trolls, i remember being pretty fascinated by all our cultural differences, when karkat and vriska were telling me about them.
i remember really sincerely trying to understand it all from their point of view! it's hard though.
i still think about the idea of black romance sometimes, and try to imagine how that really works... or "feels"... i don't know.
do you understand it?
mainly the idea of hating somebody, and translating that into attraction, or some kind of romancey feeling... it feels so alien to me.
and you're right, i have a really hard time even hating anyone in the first place!
i mean, i get ANNOYED by people, sure.
no, not really.
well, sometimes, but not much. i always tended to exaggerate my grievances with you, for the sake of laughs.
a better example is, more recently, when i was doing my retcon mission...
i was getting REALLY annoyed with terezi and her mind games.
it definitely never crossed the line to "hate" though, because we were working together to try and fix a dire situation, and even though she's weird and insane, she's otherwise a pretty good friend.
but all her needling and japes at totally inappropriate times, when there was so much on the line...
argh, it was SO FRUSTRATING.
what??
n... no!
but i don't HATE her, and i'm sure i never will!
i'm just saying i find her, like, somewhat annoying, and REALLY aggravating a lot of the time, but that's it!
ok, but...
i don't know if i'm expressing myself clearly.
i felt aggravated by her a lot, but that doesn't fully describe...
like, there were those "negative" feelings, but also...
but...
no... this is messed up!
argh!
it can't be true though...
it feels so fucked up!
what if you're right though... erg! no...
no, no, no, no...
it's fucked up though!!!
aw, man. :(
i just wanted to have a nice catch-up chat, not get so transparently owned at the trollmances.
i don't think i want it to feel normalized though!
i'm not ready to...
like, admit that... i have some warped spade crush on her, based on...
some feeling i don't understand and makes no sense to me!
oh god... what if it's true??
i have to try as hard as i can to suppress this feeling and make sure i never think about it again!
fuck.
yeah, probably.
just...
please don't tell her about any of this, ok guys?
_
523. DS39; KV50: =009391
this is really confusing though.
assuming you're right, and i am "busted" on having those feelings... and i'm not even saying you aren't.
but...
i thought humans weren't supposed to be able to feel stuff like that?
like, perceive and feel romantic stuff, in the same way trolls do.
because we're aliens to each other!
well ok, humans can feel the gay stuff pretty often, i guess.
i didn't think we could feel the spade stuff, though.
i dunno, i just thought it was some screwy biological difference?
you're probably right.
you would know better than me, at least.
no dave, i think i'm pretty squared away on rap.
at least for now. :p
yeah...
i believe you!
it's been cool though.
um...
probably not?
oh, right.
you dated jade for a while, so there's that.
i mean, dave sprite did.
and of course i mean, the one from my time, obviously not the one from this time, who died i guess before that happened.
man, that still just seems... so sad.
i guess even when you fix things, not everything can be perfect.
ok, i guess.
my sense was, it was kind of dramatic overall.
i'm not sure it was the best relationship, probably because of dave sprite's uh...
"unique issues".
but there were a lot of fun memories.
i'll tell you about them some time. maybe when jade is awake, because i'm sure she'd want to know too!
_
524. DS40: =009392
?
roxy?
she's nice!!!
really nice.
she is fun and easy to talk to...
it almost feels like she has always been one of our friends, you know?
umm...
not too long.
we only met like a day ago, i mean, from my perspective.
she's been through some really difficult stuff recently.
well, we both have, actually.
but i feel like it was all... a bit more personal for her?
being on her adventure, then suddenly losing all her friends, and watching rose die right there, while she'd been kinda viewing rose as a version of her mom...
i was just some goofball drifting randomly here and there between realities, so i was mostly just confused by everything.
but for her, i could tell it was all really devastating.
i'm so happy she gets to be with rose again!!!!!!!!!!
not to mention all her other friends!
for some reason i feel happier for her getting to reunite with people she lost than i do for myself.
i do!
oh.
... uh, hm.
i don't know.
maybe.
i didn't say i did though!!!
oh, ok.
man.
i'm not sure if we should keep thinking about all our relations that way.
it's kinda weird!
...
i'm not dating her though!
jeez.
i don't know. i...
i don't know if i'm ready for every single "deep" conversation we can squeeze into this wacky rapid fire session of fun pal-talk!
you do?
why?
...
ok, that's actually kind of cute. 
alright, well.
no matter what happens, it's ok with me if you want to think of her that way. :)
_
525. RL68; RxLa40; DS41; TP65: =009412
hey, are you guys talking about me?
what's going on!
what!!
_
526. JaEn2: =009413
hey!
mr. jake harley i presume?
oh. my mistake!
so then, is it just a coincidence that she had the same name as an invincible super villain?
are coincidences even real??
ok.
good to know!
it's been interesting to learn how even though we are all pretty similar, we all had a lot of really different life details.
like, there are all these things i take for granted about jade's childhood, which in theory is similar to yours.
but not really... she had a super powerful dog you didn't have. and also a grandpa you couldn't have had, because... that was grown up you!
i'd be really curious to hear about all the differences in your life some time, if you don't mind.
hell, i'd be REALLY curious to hear about the differences in my alt-life, so to speak.
but jane is asleep!
i'm guessing she grew up in a similar situation i did, but with... a bunch of differences???
guess i'll just have to wait!
oh! hmm.
let's see.
so i was her grandpa, instead of her being my nanna?
i'm not sure if that statement made sense, but you know what i mean.
cool!
i never knew my nanna growing up, except as an urn of ashes above the fireplace.
i only met her as a sprite.
was i dead? or... was he?
how?
no.
i've heard of it though!
sounds incredible.
definitely!
so you like movies?
haha, i love movies too.
there are a whole bunch i'd want to show you, assuming you haven't seen them already.
i love talking about them with people! i think my friends usually just humored me about the movies i liked, but i have a feeling you'd really dig them!
awesome, i can't wait to show you some.
so... that means jane had an old man corpse version of me around somewhere? like in her house?
ok, that sounds pretty preposterous to me...
but i guess she must have grown up thinking it was normal.
heheh. poor jane.
i'll have to apologize to her for freaking her out from beyond the grave.
what was her life like otherwise? 
oh, she lived with her dad too?
do you know anything about him?
a private detective???
wow.
it sounds like he must have been a completely different kind of dad from the one i had.
all these differences are so interesting... some are subtle, but some are drastic, like this one apparently is.
it would be neat to meet him.
i mean, not that it would be much of a substitute for getting to see my dad again, since they're totally different people, but...
you know what i mean.
do you know what happened to him?
jail??
i'll make a mental note to check on him some time soon.
i bet jane would want to too, when she wakes up. i'll ask her about it.
_
527. JaEn3; KV51; TS2; JS4; RS1: =009414
you know jake, at first you seemed pretty shy...
but you don't really seem that way at all now?
you just strike me as a nice regular dude who likes movies and stuff.
i'm glad we are getting a chance to talk!
heh, yeah, it is a lot of people.
i'm having trouble keeping track of everyone myself!
how were you picturing it?
yes.
i don't think you're wrong though!
well, i don't know.
we just met! what could i know about you other than what you tell me?
i believe you about all that.
really, it just sounds to me like you are going through a lot of changes.
changes are good!
especially if you understand that's what's happening to you.
i think that's how we grow and stuff.
i think i've changed in a lot of ways.
some ways that weren't easy.
sure!
so you're realizing you like being by yourself, it sounds like.
big deal!
i like being alone a lot of times too. it helps me think.
if that's who you are, there's nothing wrong with that.
jade's grandpa liked being by himself too.
so much so, that he moved to an island as far away from civilization as possible.
but he still did adventurous stuff and was super successful and also raised a cool grand daughter, who was actually his daughter, and i guess also yours.
and if nothing else...
at least you have a cool costume.
hell yes!
i wouldn't worry about that.
i love the god tier pajamas, and yours are badass.
you look like a super hero!
yes.
well...
maybe a plucky side kick, at LEAST.
side kicks are really under rated anyway.
i think in some cases they might be the real stars.
like, you know bat man?
truth be told, i think he might just be some kind of gallivanting idiot.
he's got all the money and skills in the world, and what does he do?
he buys a fancy car to drive around in, then jumps out and starts punching crooks with his bare hands.
then, when he gets horn swoggled by a wily clown with NO powers, and a LOT less money, who has to bail him out?
his side kick of course.
what is bat man even trying to prove? being all serious and "cool" looking.
his side kick looks like he has a lot more fun, and smacks of confidence and self assurance, trotting around in his underpants.
bat man probably doesn't even care much about stopping crime, it's more about walloping thugs and getting to feel cool.
if he really cared about stopping bad guys, he'd probably use his fancy money to buy guns, and at LEAST show the criminals he's packing, to make them scared, if not surrender outright.
i bet his side kick probably just has to wait for bat man to bungle things up with his stupid karate, and when he gets in trouble, the side kick just guns down all the crooks from a safe distance like a sensible person.
see? there you go.
you're better than bat man already.
hold on...
shh, listen.
(ha ha.)
(he's talking to the mayor again.)
(i just love how he talks to the mayor.)
(it's like he made up this whole language.)
(of like minimal talking and hand gestures.)
(it's so cute!)
no!
i wasn't eavesdropping...
you just happened to be like... right there.
and you're a really loud whisperer!
sorry!
go back to your cute mayor conference.
we'll mind our own business.
oh man.
what's going on now?
jaspers??
what are you...
wait a minute.
rose, is that you?!
oh my god.
i turn my back for two seconds, and something stupid happens.
_
528. VS60: =009430
vriska, wait.
before you go on, i just wanted to say...
i'm really impressed with your strategic analysis so far!
you really seem to be all over this. i wouldn't even know where to begin figuring all this stuff out.
anyway, i'm glad we have you back on our side!
just thought i'd say!
i didn't want you to go through all this stuff for us, thinking it was going unappreciated.
anyway, please continue!
_
529. VS61: =009432
i'll go!
i think so.
from what you said, it sounds like this is the most important battle.
if we don't keep her busy, everything could get messed up.
i think i'd be good at that! i can use all my windy powers for distractions and such.
_
530. VS62: =009436
what?
_
531. VS63: =009440
what is it?
you hacked my dad's wallet??
um. yeah, i guess so.
i dunno.
i still think it's a pretty special thing.
er.
...yeah.
_
532. VS64: =009442
yes, i have one.
vriska, what's YOUR part in all this, aside from making all these air tight plans?
you've been making it sound like you won't be here when all this happens!
WHAT??
wow.
isn't that going to be, uh...
hard?
are you sure you can even...
DO that?
like, by yourself, i mean.
yeah, this...
sounds weirdly familiar.
how are you going to do that?
_
533. VS65; KV52; RL69; RxLa41; JaEn4: =009443
so, is...
is that it?
is that the end of this cool strategy jam, slash fun reunion?
right. and we're supposed to go after the condensce really soon, too. right?
but not like... RIGHT away? there are still a couple hours for us to prepare.
which we should use! to come up with a fighting strategy.
i wish jade and nanna could be awake for this.
i really want to talk to them, and let them in on all the cool stuff we're about to do.
i guess they have to stay asleep for a while, though. oh well.
hey, jake!
want to come make plans with us?
we can help you figure out how to deal with robot jack, and whatever hooligans he is bringing!
ok!
_
534. VS66: =009451
jeez vriska, are they really that bad?
oh.
what is it?
_
535. RL70: =009485
the hug pile doesn't stop from getting taller.
the hug pile! there are more hugs, rose.
oh. don't you remember?
a funny quote from one of dave's old comics!
heh...
i guess i never earned that handy badge, or whatever.
i like this, though. every time someone wakes up, or pops out of nowhere, it's fun times all over again.
i feel like i should be playing reunion bingo.
who will be next??
my money is on the long awaited and insanely poignant reunion between me and casey the salamander.
what do you think she's up to?
no, she is my beautiful daughter. :p
_
536. JC1: =009486
hi nanna!
jane, i mean.
sorry, it's an easy mistake to make, because you're my nanna!
hehe, yeah so i heard!
thanks!
so do you.
my nanna, who used to be ashes on my fireplace, regained her old womanly visage when i turned her into a sprite, and she helped me along the way.
so nanna is a sprite! did you know that?
i thought you should know that. she's probably around somewhere. i hope you can meet her.
oh, also, i'm your son technically. did you know that??
yup!
_
537. JC2; RxLa42: =009487
yeah!
oh man, that's a great idea roxy.
you should try and give it to her as soon as you can!
then maybe we can all meet her before we ramp up for this battle?
sure!
see roxy? everyone thinks you should do it, because they all believe in you.
_
538. JR1: =009550
:O
:O
_
539. JR2: =009569
what??
wait, no, time out!
ridiculous cat-rose, i have stood by silently agog at your shenanigans, but i can't let that flagrant piece of misinformation go by unchallenged!
that's not how the ghost traps work.
the light blinks AFTER they catch a ghost!
yes.
i just wanted to clear that up, before you carry on with more of your silly nonsense.
anyway, please continue.
_
540. RxLa43; RL71; Ce1: =009582
ok! now that, uh... THAT little episode seems to be over...
roxy, maybe you can introduce us to your friend for real this time?
(rose, i think you can come out from under the pillow now.)
_
541. TP66; Ce2: =009583
dammit terezi!
oh my god.
you are terrible!
ok, i guess that is your opinion on that, then.
thanks for sharing, terezi.
(don't listen to her callie, she's a weirdo.)
_
542. Ce3: =009584
so, anyway, regardless of how you feel about yourself, or whatever thing a rude troll may have to say, i think you are very cute.
even though you look a lot like your terrible brother, the fact that you are nice inside makes a huge difference!
i think that when you're really a good person deep down instead of an evil jerk, the skull monster look becomes a lot more charming.
yeah!
he's garbage.
i'm really sorry you had to grow up with him.
i roughed him up a bit though, so it's all good.
ripped up his cape pretty good too.
not anymore.
hey look, there it is! heh, nice.
the ring.
i helped track it down through time for roxy, so she could give it to you.
it's so cool to see that it works!
you must be a really good friend to her, for her to want to bring you back so much.
nah, not really.
i had to save the ring anyway, and it just seemed like the right thing to do, giving it to her, since she was so worried about you.
it should be a nice thing that is between her and you. i'm just a middle man. :)
anyway, it's really nice to meet the person who finally gets to wear the highly touted ghost ring!
it probably means you are pretty special, to end up with it.
what do you think you will do with your life, now that you're alive and free from your jerky bro? 
well, don't sweat it.
you'll have a lot of time to figure it out.
that's kind of the point of life, right? to take a lot of time floundering around, figuring stuff out.
the answer will come to you eventually. you should just try to have fun!
_
543. Ce4; RL72: =009585
maybe that's why you felt weird?
seeing a version of you that wasn't like you at all?
maybe it doesn't have to work that way though?
what if those are just some facts about her, which let her come back to life, but they don't have to mean anything other than that.
like anything about having to do some huge fancy thing.
huh??
ok, i don't know what stuff you're going on about there, but i just don't think she should feel like she has to do anything she doesn't want to.
_
544. JC3; RL73: =009597
what do you think they are talking about over there?
yeah, i guess we should just chill out and give them a moment.
it isn't QUITE time to head to our battle stations yet, so we might as well try to relax until it is.
heheh, yeah, it probably is.
maybe you should try not to let her bug you, rose. she seems harmless enough.
plus, she's pretty funny!
hey, i've bumped into other johns a few times!
can't say the experience has been anything other than perfectly agreeable. :p
yes.
wow, that sounds GREAT!
i dunno.
guess you guys are just luckier than me. :)
what do you mean?
i don't think being the "real rose" necessarily means being the one who is more outgoing and chatty and powerful and stuff.
i'm not sure it means... anything?
i think maybe we should try to drop the stuff about who is the real version of who anyway. it's weird and it just hurts people's feelings.
i really don't think she is that threatening to you!
believe me, you still seem like the rose i always knew, whereas she... doesn't quite.
it seems to me she is a lot more interested in having fun and zipping around like a silly lunatic than usurping you as the main rose.
but why do you care? i thought i heard the other rose say, before she was a cat, that she liked the idea of being some sort of... backup rose.
do you not feel that way too?
step up??
hahaha. oh my god.
nothing.
i just missed you so much!
_
545. RL74: =009598
your brand has good taste in friends, and kicks ass.
hey, how do you think kanaya and karkat are doing?
do you think they'll be successful?
at...
talking to a monster?
i don't know.
so...
you think they're going to pull it off then?
well, the idea was to release the frog i think.
that's what vriska said.
you really trust kanaya, don't you?
not to change the subject too hard, into something maybe you don't want to talk about because of your brand...
but i think you make a nice couple.
yes, i thought so last time i was hanging out with you both, in the screwed up time line.
but didn't say anything then.
i think it's still true!
i'm glad it didn't change when i retconned some things.
maybe that means it's a strong relationship?
if it can survive... god.
whatever the hell happened.
a hard three year reboot, and then the sudden presence of vriska??
haha.
_
546. TP67; RL75: =009599
terezi, shoosh.
no, you said nerds twice.
you always say nerds when in ear shot of other people who are just being friendly.
what?
no.
um...
ack!!!
what was that look?!
that look you just gave me!
yes you did!
don't look at me like that!!!
oh, whatever.
hey, what are you even still doing here?
weren't you going to go with dave, and get ready for battle?
yeah, you sure do sound put off by it.
all hanging on our every word and such. :p
uh huh.
but yeah, i actually do agree...
it does sound pretty awkward to be around dave and his bro while they, um.
get to know each other, i guess?
i'm not sure how well dave really even knew his adult bro, actually.
aside from bogusly idolizing him, in a way that was really transparent that he didn't.
i wonder...
i wonder how different dirk is from him, if at all?
what do you think, rose?
...
i hope dave's ok.
_
547. TP68; RL76 =009829
hey, they're back!
_
548. RxLa44: =009830
how'd it go?
nice!
_
549. RxLa45: =009831
hehe.
hello, hummingbird.
_
550. KM10: =009832
huh?
oh.
well, i wouldn't worry about it right now.
there are more pressing things to think about, like fighting a lot of bad guys.
by the way... where's karkat?
_
551. RxLa46; KM11; RL77: =009833
what? meditating??
what the fuck is a chakra.
um.
this doesn't sound like something karkat would do.
are you sure this isn't some sort of bullshit?
wow, ok! i won't say i'm not your leader anymore, jeez.
i think it's about time to get going!
by my estimation, all the bad guys should be getting here any minute.
so we should go find the condesce and ambush her.
she's supposed to be on derse, right?
alright, then let's go.
i think we are as ready as we are going to get.
we all have weapons, cool powers, a plan of attack, and most importantly of all, each other.
never forget, team work is our secret weapon here.
probably the most powerful weapon we have!
second ONLY, perhaps, to the power of friendship itself.
remember that, guys.
as long as we have team work, friendship, and cool powers on our side, we can't lose.
you are my best friends ever... rose and roxy, and kanaya and terezi, and dave and jade and karkat, and also jane and dirk and jake, and... 
hold on, rose, i'm almost done...
and callie, and tavros, and cat rose, and um, the sweaty guy, uh, PROBABLY not the clown in the fridge though... oh, yeah, and even probably vriska.
oh, and the mayor! he's great too.
did i miss anybody? i think that's it.
anyway, i believe in you all, and i know we can do this together.
now let's go kick some ass!
how was that, rose?
huh?
wait, did i say something dumb?
a speech writer??
i dunno, rose. i think i'd be pretty bad at memorizing speeches.
especially ones YOU wrote. :p
_
552. TP68: =009836
BYE, IDIOT!!!!!!!
heh.
sorry, i guess i got carried away.
no offense.
_
553. RxLa47: =009838
what??
_
554.
